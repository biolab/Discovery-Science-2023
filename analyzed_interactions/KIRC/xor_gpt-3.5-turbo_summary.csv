The shortest path between these genes in the BioGRID network involves MYC, NR3C1, AR, ESR1, and CDK2, which are involved in various processes including transcriptional regulation and cell proliferation."
CTNNAL1*PSMD2,"Possible functional associations: Based on the shortest path in the BioGRID network, CTNNAL1 and PSMD2 are indirectly connected through proteins involved in regulating Rho signaling and protein degradation pathways. CTNNAL1 may scaffold the Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor ARHGEF1 while PSMD2 is a component of the 19S regulatory particle complex involved in the 26S proteasome. This suggests a possible role for both genes in regulating protein degradation in cancer and highlights a potential link between Rho signaling and proteasomal degradation pathways."
MYO10*PCNA,"Possible functional associations: MYO10 and PCNA both play important roles in DNA replication and repair, with PCNA serving as an auxiliary protein for DNA polymerase and MYO10 potentially involved in regulating VASP retention in spine heads to induce spine formation and expansion. However, there is currently no known direct interaction between these two genes in the literature or in the BioGRID protein interaction network."
HMG20B*HSPD1,"There is no clear evidence for a functional association between HMG20B and HSPD1. HMG20B is involved in cell cycle regulation and chromatin remodeling, while HSPD1 is a mitochondrial chaperonin implicated in protein folding and assembly."
PARP1*PCNA,"PARP1 and PCNA are functionally associated in DNA repair and damage response pathways. PARP1 interacts with PCNA to promote DNA repair and apoptosis, while PCNA acts as a loading platform to recruit PARP1 and other DDR proteins to coordinate DNA replication with repair."
HERC6*PSMB8,"Possible functional associations between HERC6 and PSMB8 include their involvement in antigen processing and viral infections. HERC6 is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that interacts with influenza A virus nucleoprotein NP and with RNA-directed RNA polymerase subunits PB1 and PB2. PSMB8, on the other hand, plays a key role in antigen processing to generate class I binding peptides and is involved in the HIV-1 TAT protein interaction. The shortest path between these genes in the BioGRID protein interaction network suggests a potential indirect interaction through other proteins involved in protein degradation and processing."
PLEKHJ1*PSMD2,"Although the exact functional association between PLEKHJ1 and PSMD2 is not known, PSMD2 is a component of the 19S proteasome regulatory particle complex involved in protein degradation, while PLEKHJ1 is a component of the MCM2-7 complex essential for DNA replication initiation. They may play a role in maintaining cellular homeostasis through regulation of protein levels during DNA replication."
KCTD5*SQSTM1,"Possible functional associations between KCTD5 and SQSTM1 could involve the regulation of protein degradation and turnover, specifically through interactions with E3 ligase complexes and autophagy. SQSTM1 is involved in selective macroautophagy and acts as a bridge between polyubiquitinated cargo and autophagosomes, while KCTD5 may act as a substrate adapter in E3 ligase complexes."
