interaction,summary
ERBB3*NFE2L2,Possible functional association between ERBB3 and NFE2L2 could be in the regulation of oxidative stress response and cytoprotection. ERBB3 may activate the NFE2L2 pathway through protein interaction network and ultimately lead to the expression of cytoprotective genes.
ECH1*RAI14,"There is no clear evidence of a direct functional association between ECH1 and RAI14. ECH1 is involved in isomerization of 3-trans,5-cis-dienoyl-CoA, while RAI14 plays a role in actin regulation at the ectoplasmic specialization in the testis."
ECH1*PDS5A,"There is currently no clear functional association between ECH1 and PDS5A. ECH1 is involved in fatty acid metabolism, while PDS5A is involved in sister chromatid cohesion during mitosis and DNA repair."
STAP2*TRAK2,"Possible functional associations between STAP2 and TRAK2 could be related to endosomal trafficking and signaling pathways, as both proteins have been shown to interact with membrane cargo and signaling molecules. STAP2 may modulate STAT3 activity while TRAK2 may regulate endosome-to-lysosome trafficking of membrane cargo, including EGFR."
FYN*GNPDA1,"Possible functional association between FYN and GNPDA1 in TCGA-KIRC cancer may involve regulation of cell growth and survival, cell adhesion, and integrin-mediated signaling by FYN, and the fine-tuning of metabolic fluctuations of cytosolic UDP-GlcNAc and their effects on hyaluronan synthesis by GNPDA1. The shortest path between the two proteins in the BioGRID protein interaction network is PLEKHA4, which indicates a potential indirect interaction between these proteins."
ADAM10*STAP2,Possible functional associations: ADAM10 interacts with EGFR and promotes cytotoxic activity of S.aureus hly; STAP2 is a substrate of protein kinase PTK6 and may modulate STAT3 activity. These genes may have a role in immune response and inflammation. It's possible that EGFR may activate STAT3 through STAP2 and ADAM10 could play a role in regulating inflammation via its interaction with S. aureus hly.
STAP2*TLR4,"Possible functional associations between STAP2 and TLR4 could be in the regulation of inflammatory response and immune function. STAP2 may modulate STAT3 activity and interact with CSF1R, while TLR4 cooperates with LY96 and CD14 to mediate the innate immune response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide, leading to NF-kappa-B activation and cytokine secretion. The shortest path between STAP2 and TLR4 in the BioGRID protein interaction network is through the intermediate protein MYD88."
CLTC*DNAJB2,"Possible functional associations between CLTC and DNAJB2 include their interaction in the TACC3/ch-TOG/clathrin complex, which contributes to stabilization of kinetochore fibers of the mitotic spindle, maintenance of kinetochore fiber tension, and early autophagosome formation. DNAJB2 also regulates the ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation of misfolded proteins, while CLTC is involved in autophagosome formation and interacts with ATG16L1."
CDC42*ERBB3,"Possible functional associations between CDC42 and ERBB3 include regulation of cell migration and myeloid cell differentiation. CDC42 is a plasma membrane-associated small GTPase involved in polarity processes, while ERBB3 is a tyrosine-protein kinase receptor involved in neuregulin signaling. The shortest path between these genes suggests they may interact directly or indirectly through intermediate proteins in a complex regulatory network."
RHOA*STAP2,"Possible functional associations between RHOA and STAP2 in TCGA-KIRC may involve regulation of inflammation and acute-phase response, as STAP2 interacts with CSF1R and modulates STAT3 activity, while RHOA is a target for cysteine peptidase from Yersinia pestis and can facilitate virus-induced syncytium formation. There is no solid biological evidence suggesting that these two genes interact at this time."
HDAC6*PCMT1,"There are no known direct functional associations between HDAC6 and PCMT1. HDAC6 deacetylates histones and other proteins, while PCMT1 catalyzes methyl esterification of damaged proteins. However, their interaction in a protein interaction network suggests they may indirectly influence each other's functions."
ATP11B*ATP1B1,"Possible functional associations between ATP11B and ATP1B1 may involve regulation of epithelial cell polarity, as ATP1B1 is involved in this process, while ATP11B may contribute to the maintenance of membrane lipid asymmetry. Additionally, ATP1B1 interacts with NKAIN1, NKAIN2, and NKAIN4, while ATP11B interacts with HLA-C, suggesting potential interactions in the immune response."
CLTC*STAP2,"Possible functional associations: CLTC and STAP2 have a shortest path interaction via IKBKB, EGFR, and HNRNPL and are involved in cellular processes such as autophagy, mitotic spindle stabilization, and acute-phase response. However, their specific functional association in TCGA-KIRC remains unclear."
KDM5A*NDUFC1,"Possible functional association between KDM5A and NDUFC1 is that KDM5A may play a role in the regulation of the circadian rhythm and increase histone acetylation at clock-controlled genes, including NDUFC1, through inhibiting HDAC1 activity. NDUFC1 is an accessory subunit of mitochondrial membrane respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase, which functions in the transfer of electrons from NADH to the respiratory chain."
