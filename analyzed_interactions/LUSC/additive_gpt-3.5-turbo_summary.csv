BIRC2*IKBKE,"BIRC2 regulates apoptosis, cellular proliferation, innate immune signaling, and the NF-kappa B and NEDD8 conjugation pathways. IKBKE plays essential roles in regulating inflammatory response to viral infection, activates type I IFN and STAT signaling, and induces the transcription of pro-inflammatory and antiviral genes. Given their functions, BIRC2 and IKBKE may interact in the regulation of innate immune signaling and cellular response to viral infection."
GAPDH*PAFAH1B1,"Possible functional associations: There is no direct biological relationship between GAPDH and PAFAH1B1, but they are connected through multiple protein interactions in the BioGRID network.   GAPDH is involved in glycolysis, microtubule organization and assembly, interferon-induced translation inhibition, and innate immunity, among other nuclear functions, while PAFAH1B1 is a regulatory subunit of the cytosolic type I platelet-activating factor (PAF) acetylhydrolase. PAFAH1B1 is required for proper activation of Rho GTPases and actin polymerization, among other functions, and may modulate the Reelin pathway."
MBNL2*STX1A,"It is difficult to infer a specific functional association between MBNL2 and STX1A based solely on the provided resources. However, MBNL2 mediates alternative splicing regulation while STX1A plays an essential role in exocytosis, suggesting a potential indirect functional relationship between the two genes in specific biological contexts where these processes may intersect."
AMDHD2*CBLB,"There is no clear functional association between AMDHD2 and CBLB based on their respective biological roles and interactions. AMDHD2 hydrolyzes N-glycolylglucosamine, whereas CBLB is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase involved in inhibiting signal transduction pathways. The shortest path between the two genes in the BioGRID network involves PARK2, a gene involved in protein degradation and Parkinson's disease, suggesting a potential indirect association through protein degradation pathways."
MYC*SPAG4,"MYC is a transcription factor that activates the transcription of growth-related genes, while SPAG4 is involved in spermatogenesis and required for sperm head formation. There is no clear biological context indicating a functional association between these two genes."
GAPDH*SGCB,"One possible functional association between GAPDH and SGCB could be in the regulation of cytoskeleton organization and assembly, as GAPDH has been shown to modulate these processes and SGCB is a component of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex which forms a link between F-actin cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix. Additionally, both genes have been implicated in processes related to innate immunity and inflammation."
PTPRC*STX1A,"Possible functional associations between PTPRC and STX1A in TCGA-LUSC may involve regulation of calcium-dependent exocytosis and endocytosis in T-cells and neurotransmitter release in the nervous system. PTPRC acts as a receptor for human cytomegalovirus protein UL11 and mediates binding of UL11 to T-cells, while STX1A plays an essential role in hormone and neurotransmitter calcium-dependent exocytosis and endocytosis. The shortest path between PTPRC and STX1A in the BioGRID protein interaction network involves several intermediate proteins, including ARL13B, indicating possible indirect regulation of STX1A by PTPRC."
DECR1*GAPDH,"Possible functional associations: DECR1 is involved in beta-oxidation of fatty acids while GAPDH plays a role in glycolysis and nuclear functions. While there is no direct biological link known between DECR1 and GAPDH, they both participate in metabolic processes within the cell."
CSNK1E*SSBP2,"Possible functional association between CSNK1E and SSBP2 is in the ERK signaling pathway, where SSBP2 inhibits the dephosphorylation of ERK by phosphatase PP2A-PPP2R5C holoenzyme, while CSNK1E participates in Wnt signaling and phosphorylates DVL1 and DVL2, components of the Wnt pathway. There is no direct evidence of a biological interaction between these two genes."
GABPB1*GAPDH,"Possible functional associations between GABPB1 and GAPDH may be related to transcriptional regulation and glycolysis pathways. GABPB1 is a transcriptional regulator and GAPDH is a key enzyme in glycolysis, but both genes also have roles in inflammation, immune response, and nuclear events such as transcription and apoptosis. Therefore, it is possible that these two genes may be involved in coordinating transcriptional regulation and metabolic processes in cancer cells."
GAPDH*NMT1,"Possible functional associations between GAPDH and NMT1 may include their involvement in glycolysis and nuclear functions, respectively. GAPDH is a key enzyme in glycolysis, while NMT1 adds a myristoyl group to the N-terminal glycine residue of certain cellular and viral proteins. However, there is no direct evidence of functional association between these two genes."
BAD*BCL2,BAD promotes cell death by competing with Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L) for binding to BAX. BCL2 suppresses apoptosis by controlling mitochondrial membrane permeability and inhibiting caspase activity. These genes may interact in regulating cell death processes through their binding and competition for BAX.
CEBPD*EBNA1BP2,"One possible functional association between CEBPD and EBNA1BP2 is involvement in immune and inflammatory responses. CEBPD is a transcription activator that regulates the expression of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses, while EBNA1BP2 interacts with EBV EBNA1 and is required for the processing of the 27S pre-rRNA. The shortest path between them in the BioGRID protein interaction network includes RB1, EP300, FBXW7, HIST1H4A, and SOX2 as intermediaries."
IKBKE*KAT6A,"Possible functional associations between IKBKE and KAT6A include IKBKE-mediated phosphorylation of p53 at lysine residues, which is controlled by KAT6A's association with PML. Additionally, the BioGRID protein interaction network shows that IKBKE and KAT6A are connected via several intermediate proteins, including ATIC, which is involved in purine biosynthesis, and ESR1, which is a nuclear hormone receptor that regulates gene expression in response to estrogen."
BHLHE40*RRP8,"Possible functional associations between BHLHE40 and RRP8 could involve transcriptional regulation and chromatin modification in response to intracellular energy status, as RRP8 is a component of the eNoSC complex involved in silencing rDNA, while BHLHE40 is a transcriptional repressor involved in circadian rhythm regulation and acts as a corepressor of RXR and RXR-LXR heterodimers. The shortest paths in the BioGRID protein interaction network suggest a potential direct physical interaction between these two proteins."
RTN2*VAV3,"One possible functional association between RTN2 and VAV3 is their involvement in cell membrane trafficking and organization. RTN2 has been shown to facilitate the translocation of glucose transporters, while VAV3 plays a role in integrin-mediated signaling and cell adhesion. The shortest path between them in the BioGRID protein interaction network suggests a potential direct interaction between the two proteins, potentially indicating their collaboration in these processes."
GAPDH*KAT6A,"Possible functional associations between GAPDH and KAT6A include their involvement in transcriptional regulation, apoptosis, and DNA replication. GAPDH has both glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and nitrosylase activities, while KAT6A is a histone acetyltransferase that acetylates lysine residues in histone H3 and H4. The shortest path in the BioGRID protein interaction network between these genes suggest that they may interact with each other through intermediary proteins such as ATXN1, CCNB1, EP300, TP53, and ATN1."
EBNA1BP2*SPAG4,"As there is a shortest path protein interaction between EBNA1BP2 and SPAG4 via PAXIP1, it is possible that these genes may be functionally associated in some way during spermatogenesis or in maintaining nuclear envelope integrity. EBNA1BP2 is required for the processing of the 27S pre-rRNA and interacts with WDR46, while SPAG4 is involved in sperm head formation, anchoring and organization of the manchette, and ODF assembly while interacting with SEPT12 and LMNB1."
AKT1*IKBKE,"AKT1 and IKBKE are functionally associated through their involvement in the regulation of cell survival, proliferation, and inflammation. AKT1 regulates multiple downstream substrates involved in these processes, and IKBKE plays an essential role in regulating inflammatory responses to viral infection as well as the induction of antiviral genes. The shortest path of the protein interaction network between these two genes involves several other proteins involved in immune responses and cell survival."
CDC42*GNA15,"Possible functional associations: CDC42 is a small GTPase that regulates cellular responses such as cell migration, filopodia formation, and phagocytosis. GNA15 is involved in transmembrane signaling systems as a modulator or transducer. It is unclear from the provided context whether CDC42 and GNA15 have any direct functional associations."
FKBP4*NUP62,"There is no clear functional association between the two genes, as FKBP4 is involved in protein trafficking and microtubule dynamics, while NUP62 is a component of the nuclear pore complex and plays a role in mitotic cell cycle progression. However, they share a protein interaction network pathway and may indirectly interact through other proteins."
STX1A*TM9SF2,"Possible functional association: STX1A and TM9SF2 may both be involved in intracellular transport or membrane fusion, as STX1A plays a role in calcium-dependent exocytosis and endocytosis, and TM9SF2 may function as a channel or small molecule transporter. The BioGRID protein interaction network suggests that these genes may interact indirectly through CFTR and MMGT1."
SATB1*SUCLG1,"There is currently no known functional association between SATB1 and SUCLG1 in the literature. SATB1 is a transcriptional regulator involved in chromatin organization and nuclear architecture, while SUCLG1 functions in the citric acid cycle as a succinyl-CoA synthetase."
