A possible biological process linking these genes could be the regulation of immune and pro-inflammatory responses."
BNIP3*DNM1L,"Possible functional associations: BNIP3 and DNM1L both play a role in mitochondrial quality control. BNIP3 interacts with DNM1L in the BioGRID protein interaction network, potentially indicating a role in mitochondrial fission. Both genes are involved in apoptotic pathways and have been linked to cell death processes in various contexts."
ATF6*KDM3A,"Possible functional association: KDM3A may be involved in hormone-dependent transcriptional activation by participating in recruitment to androgen-receptor target genes where ATF6 could be a potential target. Additionally, ATF6 has been implicated in ER stress response and KDM3A has been shown to regulate metabolic genes, potentially linking the two in these processes."
