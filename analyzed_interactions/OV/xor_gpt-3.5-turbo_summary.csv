Both genes may have a role in maintaining the integrity of epithelial barriers, such as those in the gastrointestinal tract or the lung."
ATF6*KDM3A,"Possible functional associations between ATF6 and KDM3A are currently unknown, as they have distinct roles in different biological processes. ATF6 is a transcription factor that initiates the unfolded protein response, while KDM3A is a histone demethylase involved in hormone-dependent transcriptional activation and spermatogenesis. The shortest path in the BioGRID protein interaction network between ATF6 and KDM3A is through RIPK2."
FOXO4*HIF1A,"Possible functional associations between FOXO4 and HIF1A include regulation of hypoxia-induced transcriptional activation and cellular response to stress. FOXO4 downregulates HIF1A expression and suppresses its hypoxia-induced transcriptional activation, while HIF1A promotes glycolysis and inflammatory response in monocytes. These genes may play opposing roles in regulating cellular response to stress in the context of cancer."
ITGB5*PRAF2,"Possible functional associations between ITGB5 and PRAF2 could involve regulation of vesicular traffic and apoptosis in neuroblastoma. In a more specific context, ITGB5 may act as a receptor for adenovirus type C, while PRAF2 interacts with CCR5 and GDE1."
ATF6*HIF1A,"There is a possible functional association between ATF6 and HIF1A in the transcriptional response to endoplasmic reticulum stress and cellular adaptation to hypoxia, respectively.
