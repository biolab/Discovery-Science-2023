interaction,summary
MRPL12*ZNF131,"Possible functional associations between MRPL12 and ZNF131 could include transcriptional regulation and organogenesis. MRPL12 is involved in mitochondrial translation as a component of the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit, while ZNF131 plays a role in development and may be involved in transcriptional regulation as a repressor of ESR1/ER-alpha signaling and interacts with several receptors involved in endocytosis. However, without further information or experimental evidence, any specific association between these two genes cannot be confirmed."
DUSP11*PSMB10,"Possible functional associations between DUSP11 and PSMB10 may include involvement in antigen processing, nuclear mRNA metabolism, and RNA binding based on their respective functions and shared protein interactions. However, further research is needed to understand the specific biological processes in which these genes may interact."
AKAP8L*PSMB1,"Possible functional associations between AKAP8L and PSMB1 could be related to protein degradation as PSMB1 is a component of the proteasome complex involved in protein degradation, while AKAP8L interacts with proteins involved in protein degradation and cellular homeostasis. The shortest path between these genes in the BioGRID protein interaction network suggests they may be involved in similar biological pathways, such as mitosis or response to viral infection, potentially through interactions with other proteins in the network."
RAB11FIP2*TWF2,"There is no clear functional association between RAB11FIP2 and TWF2 based on their known roles in biology. RAB11FIP2 is involved in the regulation of vesicle transport and phagocytosis, while TWF2 is involved in actin regulation and endocytosis. The shortest path in the BioGRID protein interaction network between these two genes is through YWHAE and ZRANB1."
TMED10*TRAPPC3,"TMED10 and TRAPPC3 are both involved in vesicular trafficking and protein quality control in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi. There is a direct protein-protein interaction between them, indicating a possible functional association in this process."
ALDOA*TCEAL4,"Possible functional association: TCEAL4 may be involved in transcriptional regulation, and interacts with the protein product of the viral gene ORF45, which activates RPS6KA1. ALDOA catalyzes a key step in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, and may also function as a scaffolding protein. There is no known direct biological relationship between these two genes based on current literature."
GNAS*PSMG1,"Possible functional association: GNAS and PSMG1 may interact in the proteasome assembly process as PSMG1 forms a heterodimer with PSMG2 to promote assembly of the proteasome alpha subunits, while GNAS interacts with MAGED2, which is known to regulate proteasomal function."
HINT1*TMED10,"Possible functional associations between HINT1 and TMED10 are not immediately clear from the given context. HINT1 is involved in nucleotide metabolism, transcriptional regulation, and protein degradation, while TMED10 functions in protein vesicular trafficking and quality control in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi. Further experimental evidence is needed to determine any specific biological connections between these two genes."
ATP5G3*BAMBI,"There are no clear functional associations between ATP5G3 and BAMBI based on their known biological processes and interactions in the provided context. ATP5G3 is involved in mitochondrial ATP synthesis, while BAMBI negatively regulates TGF-beta signaling and interacts with microtubules and FGF2."
EIF5*HLA-DMA,"Possible functional associations: EIF5 is involved in ribosomal initiation complex formation while HLA-DMA has a critical role in the release of class II-associated invariant chain peptide from MHC class II. Though they do not have any direct interactions, their involvement in protein synthesis and antigen processing suggest indirect functional associations in regulating immune responses."
CXCR4*PMAIP1,"Possible functional associations between CXCR4 and PMAIP1 include their role in regulating apoptosis and mitochondrial membrane changes. CXCR4 acts as a coreceptor for HIV entry and interacts with Staphylococcus aureus protein SSL10. PMAIP1 promotes activation of caspases, interacts with MCL1, BAK1, BIM/BCL2L11, BCL2A1, BAX, and BCL2L10, and competes with BAK1 and BIM/BCL2L11 for binding to MCL1."
ELOVL6*PEX11A,"Possible functional association: PEX11A is involved in peroxisomal proliferation and elongation on the peroxisomal surface, while ELOVL6 catalyzes the first and rate-limiting reaction in the elongation cycle of long-chain fatty acids. It is possible that PEX11A plays a role in the localization of ELOVL6 to the peroxisomal membrane, where it can carry out its function in fatty acid elongation."
MTX2*OXA1L,"Possible functional associations between MTX2 and OXA1L in TCGA-OV could be related to mitochondrial protein transport, membrane protein insertion, and biogenesis of ATP synthase and complex I. MTX2 is involved in protein transport into the mitochondrion and interacts with the mitochondrial outer membrane sorting assembly machinery (SAM) complex, which includes OXA1L. OXA1L is required for the insertion of integral membrane proteins into the mitochondrial inner membrane and for ATP synthase and complex I biogenesis."
ATP6V0B*RPA1,"There is no clear functional association between ATP6V0B and RPA1. ATP6V0B is involved in acidifying and maintaining the pH of intracellular compartments, while RPA1 binds and stabilizes single-stranded DNA intermediates and plays a role in DNA replication and the cellular response to DNA damage."
BACE2*BIRC5,"BACE2 is involved in proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein and melanosome biogenesis. BIRC5 is a multitasking protein involved in cell proliferation, preventing apoptosis, chromosome passage, and maintenance of mitochondrial integrity. There are no known specific functional associations between these genes in biological terms."
BACE2*PNP,"There doesn't seem to be a clear functional association between BACE2 and PNP in the context provided. BACE2 is responsible for the proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein, whereas PNP is a hormonal regulator and component of mitochondrial ribosomes. The shortest path between the two in the BioGRID protein interaction network involves intervening proteins nsp6, NPC1, and ORF3a."
DNMT3A*PSME1,"DNMT3A is involved in DNA methylation and imprinting, while PSME1 is implicated in immunoproteasome assembly and antigen processing. There is no clear biological link between these two genes, but they interact indirectly through several other proteins in the BioGRID protein interaction network."
