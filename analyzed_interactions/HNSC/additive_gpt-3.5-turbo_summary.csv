interaction,summary
BNIP3*CDC42,"Possible functional associations between BNIP3 and CDC42 may involve regulation of mitochondrial quality control, cellular responses, cell migration, and filopodia and podosomes formation. They may also play a role in regulating dendritic spine structural plasticity and phagocytosis. However, without further experimental validation, the specific biological terms in which these two genes may interact is unclear."
DNAJC15*OXA1L,"Possible functional associations between DNAJC15 and OXA1L are their involvement in mitochondrial function, specifically in the assembly and activity of complexes I and IV of the electron transport chain. DNAJC15 is a negative regulator of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, while OXA1L is required for the insertion of integral membrane proteins into the mitochondrial inner membrane."
BNIP3*CCND3,"There is no known direct functional association between BNIP3 and CCND3. BNIP3 is involved in mitochondrial quality control and apoptosis, while CCND3 is involved in regulating the cell cycle. However, both genes have been implicated in cancer, possibly suggesting indirect functional associations through altered cellular processes involved in tumorigenesis."
AXIN1*CDK1,Possible functional associations: AXIN1 and CDK1 are connected in the BioGRID protein interaction network through a shortest path of 5 nodes. AXIN1 is a component of the beta-catenin destruction complex and modulates Wnt signaling. CDK1 is involved in cell cycle regulation and can interact with virus-causing agents. There may not be a direct biological functional association between these two genes within the context of TCGA-HNSC.
CCDC85B*GALE,"Possible functional association: CCDC85B may interact with GALE in the process of galactose catabolism, as GALE catalyzes a critical step in this pathway. The shortest protein interaction path between CCDC85B and GALE via SOX2 may reflect a functional relationship mediated by transcriptional regulation."
CTSL1*USP14,"Possible functional association: Both CTSL1 and USP14 are involved in protein degradation pathways, with CTSL1 cleaving the CUX1 transcription factor and modifying its properties and USP14 being a proteasome-associated deubiquitinase. There is currently no known direct interaction between the two proteins."
SFN*SNX7,"Possible functional association between SFN and SNX7 is in endocytosis regulation and intracellular trafficking. SFN is a 3'-to-5'exoribonuclease involved in DNA and RNA degradation, while SNX7 is involved in autophagosome assembly and recyling of phospholipid scramblase ATG9A. The shortest path between SFN and SNX7 in BioGRID protein interaction network involves NTRK3."
CXCR4*HMGCS1,"Possible functional associations between CXCR4 and HMGCS1 are unclear from the provided context. CXCR4 is a receptor for HIV and interacts with Staphylococcus aureus protein SSL10, while HMGCS1 catalyzes the synthesis of mevalonate, a precursor for cholesterol production. The shortest paths between these genes in the BioGRID protein interaction network involve intermediate genes CERS5, SLC22A5, and TRIM67."
AKT1*BNIP3,"AKT1 and BNIP3 are functionally associated in the regulation of apoptosis and cellular energy metabolism. AKT1 is a serine/threonine-protein kinase that regulates processes including cell survival, growth, and angiogenesis. BNIP3 is an apoptosis-inducing protein that plays a role in mitochondrial quality control and the degradation of damaged proteins inside mitochondria. The shortest path in the BioGRID protein interaction network between AKT1 and BNIP3 includes PINK1, BCL2L1, HIF1A, and PARK2, which are involved in mitochondrial processes and regulation of apoptosis."
BNIP3*TOMM70A,"Possible functional association between BNIP3 and TOMM70A is their role in mitochondrial quality control. BNIP3 is involved in mitochondrial protein catabolism, while TOMM70A acts as receptor for translocation of mitochondrial preproteins. Both genes are also involved in microbial infection pathways."
COG7*EIF4G1,"There is currently no evidence of a direct functional association between COG7 and EIF4G1. COG7 is involved in normal Golgi function, while EIF4G1 is a component of the eIF4F complex that is required for mRNA recognition and translation initiation. The protein interaction network shows they are indirectly connected through several other proteins, including EGFR, HNRNPD, NTRK1, RAB1A, and TNIP2."
CGRRF1*SFN,"Possible functional association: CGRRF1 interacts with EGFR, ITCH, and GPC1, while SFN is a 3'-to-5'exoribonuclease that preferentially degrades DNA and RNA oligonucleotides. These genes may have a role in regulating cellular growth pathways and RNA metabolism."
CHEK1*DAXX,"Possible functional associations between CHEK1 and DAXX include DNA damage response and regulation of transcription. CHEK1 is involved in cell cycle checkpoint regulation and response to DNA damage, while DAXX is a transcription corepressor and may be involved in regulating the activity of transcription factors. The shortest path between them in the BioGRID protein interaction network suggests that they may interact through a number of intermediaries, including CSNK2A1 and TP53."
DRAP1*TMCO1,"There are no known direct functional associations between DRAP1 and TMCO1. DRAP1 is involved in transcriptional repression by inhibiting the association of TFIIA and/or TFIIB with TBP, while TMCO1 functions as a calcium-selective channel required to prevent calcium stores from overfilling and as a component of the multi-pass translocon (MPT) complex for protein insertion into membranes."
DYNLT3*GNA11,"Based on their protein interaction network, DYNLT3 and GNA11 may function together in intracellular transport, with DYNLT3 serving as an accessory component of the cytoplasmic dynein 1 motor complex and GNA11 as an activator of phospholipase C. However, there is currently no direct evidence for a functional association between these two genes in specific biological processes in the context of TCGA-HNSC cancer type."
DRAP1*SNX7,There is currently no known functional association between DRAP1 and SNX7. DRAP1 is involved in transcriptional regulation while SNX7 is involved in endocytosis and intracellular trafficking.
SRP14*USP14,"Possible functional associations between SRP14 and USP14 in TCGA-HNSC could be related to protein synthesis and degradation as SRP14 is involved in the targeting of secretory and membrane proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum and USP14 is a proteasome-associated deubiquitinase. The shortest path between these two genes in the BioGRID protein interaction network involves multiple ribosomal and proteasome subunits, suggesting potential interactions in protein turnover and quality control."
