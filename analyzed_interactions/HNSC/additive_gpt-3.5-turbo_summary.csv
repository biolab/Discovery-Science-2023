interaction,summary
BNIP3*TOMM70A,"One possible functional association between BNIP3 and TOMM70A is their involvement in mitochondrial quality control and protein transport. BNIP3 plays a role in mitochondrial protein catabolism and interacts with TOMM70A, which acts as a receptor for mitochondrial preproteins. Additionally, both genes are involved in the response to microbial infections and apoptosis."
BNIP3*CCND3,"Possible functional association between BNIP3 and CCND3 is that BNIP3 is involved in mitochondrial quality control while CCND3 is involved in the cell-cycle regulation, suggesting a potential link between apoptotic and cell-cycle pathways. The shortest path between BNIP3 and CCND3 in the protein interaction network involves a protein PARK2, which is also important for mitochondrial quality control."
DRAP1*TMCO1,"There doesn't seem to be a clear functional association between DRAP1 and TMCO1 based on the provided context and known biology. DRAP1 is involved in transcriptional repression and can bind DNA on its own or form a heterodimer with DR1, while TMCO1 is a calcium-selective channel and component of the multi-pass translocon complex involved in membrane protein insertion."
DNAJC15*OXA1L,"Possible functional associations between DNAJC15 and OXA1L include their involvement in mitochondrial processes related to the respiratory chain and ATP synthase biogenesis, as well as their interactions with the TIM23 complex and the mitochondrial ribosome. DNAJC15 appears to negatively regulate mitochondrial respiratory chain activity, while OXA1L is required for the activity and assembly of cytochrome oxidase and ATP synthase. The direct interaction between DNAJC15 and PAM16/MAGMAS may counteract the DNAJC15-dependent stimulation of HSPA9 ATPase activity, while interactions with MRPL13, MRPL20, MRPL28, MRPL48, MRPL49, and MRPL51 suggest a role for OXA1L in mitochondrial ribosome function."
BNIP3*CDC42,"Based on their roles in mitochondrial quality control and cell death pathways, BNIP3 and CDC42 could potentially be involved in regulating cell survival and apoptosis. However, there is no clear evidence of direct functional association between these two genes in specific biological terms."
CXCR4*HMGCS1,"Possible functional associations between CXCR4 and HMGCS1 include their involvement in microbial infection and cholesterol synthesis, respectively. There is no known direct biological interaction between these two genes based on the available information."
SFN*SNX7,"Possible functional associations between SFN and SNX7 could involve regulation of intracellular trafficking and endocytosis. The shortest path in the BioGRID protein interaction network between these two genes involves NTRK3, which is a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in cellular processes such as differentiation and apoptosis."
DYNLT3*GNA11,"Possible functional associations between DYNLT3 and GNA11 may involve intracellular transport and signaling pathways. DYNLT3 is a component of the cytoplasmic dynein 1 complex, which is involved in retrograde transport of vesicles and organelles along microtubules. GNA11 is a guanine nucleotide-binding protein involved in signaling pathways, such as activation of phospholipase C. It is possible that DYNLT3 may be involved in transport of GNA11 or its associated signaling components."
AXIN1*CDK1,"AXIN1 and CDK1 are functionally associated in the regulation of the cell cycle. AXIN1 is a tumor suppressor and modulates Wnt-signaling, while CDK1 is a cyclin-dependent kinase that promotes cell cycle progression. The shortest path between AXIN1 and CDK1 in the BioGRID protein interaction network suggests a potential regulatory interaction."
CTSL1*USP14,There is no immediate evidence of a functional association between CTSL1 and USP14. CTSL1 is involved in cell cycle regulation through proteolytic processing while USP14 is a proteasome-associated deubiquitinase.
AKT1*BNIP3,"AKT1 and BNIP3 are connected by a protein interaction network and are involved in regulating processes such as metabolism, cell survival, and apoptosis. Their potential functional association could involve AKT1 regulating BNIP3-mediated mitochondrial quality control and cell death pathways."
CGRRF1*SFN,"Possible functional associations between CGRRF1 and SFN could be their involvement in cell growth inhibition and interaction with intracellular signaling pathways. CGRRF1 inhibits growth in cell lines by binding to the intracellular domain of tumor necrosis factor type 1 receptor, while SFN is a p53-regulated inhibitor of G2/M progression and interacts with several proteins including GAB2, SRPK2, and COPS6. The shortest path between these genes in the BioGRID interaction network via EGFR, ITCH, and GPC1 suggests that they may also have a role in receptor tyrosine kinase signaling and protein ubiquitination."
SRP14*USP14,"Possible functional association: Both genes are involved in protein targeting and degradation processes, with SRP14 involved in cotranslational targeting of secretory and membrane proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and USP14 releasing ubiquitin from proteasome-targeted ubiquitinated proteins. There is no direct biological link between these two genes based on known functions."
DRAP1*SNX7,"Possible functional associations: DRAP1 and SNX7 may play a role in autophagosome assembly and intracellular trafficking. Based on the BioGRID protein interaction network, they are connected by several intermediary proteins involved in transcription regulation and RNA processing."
COG7*EIF4G1,"Possible functional associations between COG7 and EIF4G1 in TCGA-HNSC cancer type include a role in Golgi function and mRNA translation. These genes are part of different protein complexes, but their interactions through the BioGRID protein interaction network suggest a connection in the regulation of translational processes in the cell."
CCDC85B*GALE,Possible functional associations are uncertain based on the provided context. CCDC85B plays a role in HDV genomic replication through interaction with HDAG. GALE catalyzes reactions critical in galactose metabolism and contributes to biosynthesis of UDP-sugars important in glycoprotein and glycolipid synthesis.
CHEK1*DAXX,Possible functional associations between CHEK1 and DAXX include their interaction in the DNA damage response pathway and regulation of apoptosis. CHEK1 is a checkpoint kinase involved in DNA damage response while DAXX is a transcription corepressor and modulator of TNFRSF6-dependent apoptosis. The shortest path between CHEK1 and DAXX in the BioGRID protein interaction network suggests their direct interaction through multiple intermediates.
