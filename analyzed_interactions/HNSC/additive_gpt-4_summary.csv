interaction,summary
BNIP3*TOMM70A,"BNIP3 is involved in apoptosis induction, mitochondrial quality control, and calcium repartitioning, while TOMM70A acts as a receptor for the preprotein translocase complex in the outer mitochondrial membrane and mediates antiviral responses during virus infection. A possible functional association between these two genes could be related to their roles in mitochondrial regulation and protein translocation across the outer mitochondrial membrane. Both BNIP3 and TOMM70A take part in the interactions with different proteins in response to cellular signaling and stress, such as having dual roles in apoptosis and viral infection control."
BNIP3*CCND3,"BNIP3 is involved in apoptosis-induction, mitochondrial quality control, and calcium repartitioning, while CCND3 is a regulatory component of the cell cycle, specifically in the G1/S transition phase. A possible functional association between these two genes could be related to the cell cycle and cell death regulation, where BNIP3's apoptotic role may counterbalance CCND3's mitogenic functions. This balance might be critical in maintaining proper cell progression and cellular homeostasis."
DRAP1*TMCO1,"DRAP1 is involved in the repression of activated and basal transcription of class II genes, while TMCO1 plays a crucial role in calcium homeostasis and insertion of multi-pass membrane proteins. A possible functional association between these genes could be related to transcriptional regulation of genes involved in calcium homeostasis or membrane proteins affected by DRAP1 and TMCO1 action."
DNAJC15*OXA1L,"DNAJC15 is a negative regulator of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and an import component of the TIM23 translocase complex, while OXA1L is involved in the insertion of integral membrane proteins into the mitochondrial inner membrane and the biogenesis of ATP synthase and complex I. One possible functional association between these genes could be their involvement in mitochondrial electron transfer and protein homeostasis. Both genes play a role in regulating the assembly and function of protein complexes within the mitochondria."
BNIP3*CDC42,"Possible functional associations between BNIP3 and CDC42 include their involvement in cellular responses and mitochondrial quality control. Specifically, BNIP3 is an apoptosis-inducing protein that plays a role in calcium repartitioning and mitochondrial protein catabolic processes, while CDC42 is a plasma membrane-associated small GTPase involved in cell polarity, migration, and the formation of filopodia in neurons. Both genes may contribute to the regulation of cellular processes and dynamics in the context of cancer development."
CXCR4*HMGCS1,"CXCR4, a chemokine receptor, has been implicated in microbial infections, specifically HIV entry into human cells. HMGCS1 is a key enzyme involved in cholesterol synthesis, catalyzing the formation of HMG-CoA. While there is no direct functional association reported between CXCR4 and HMGCS1, one potential link could be the roles they play in cell signaling and membrane structure, respectively."
SFN*SNX7,"SFN is a 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease involved in the degradation of DNA and RNA oligonucleotides, and it forms homodimers and homotetramers. SNX7 is involved in the regulation of endocytosis and intracellular trafficking, and forms heterodimers with SNX4. A possible functional association between SFN and SNX7 could be related to the regulation of cellular degradation processes and recycling of nucleic acids during endocytosis and intracellular trafficking events."
DYNLT3*GNA11,"DYNLT3 is involved in linking dynein to cargos and adapter proteins for intracellular retrograde motility of vesicles and organelles along microtubules. GNA11 acts as a modulator or transducer in transmembrane signaling systems, including activation of phospholipase C. There might be an indirect functional association between these two genes in intracellular trafficking and signaling processes, but a direct interaction is not evident from the given context."
AXIN1*CDK1,"Possible functional associations between AXIN1 and CDK1 are through their involvement in cell cycle regulation and proliferation. AXIN1 is a component of the beta-catenin destruction complex, which regulates Wnt signaling and modulates cell growth and development. CDK1 plays a crucial role in regulating cell division and is involved in cell cycle progression. These genes may interact indirectly through the proteins they interact within their respective pathways, suggesting a potential link between Wnt signaling modulation and cell cycle progression."
CTSL1*USP14,"CTSL1 is involved in cell cycle progression through proteolytic processing of the CUX1 transcription factor, while USP14 is a proteasome-associated deubiquitinase involved in protein degradation and cellular processes like ERAD and immune defense. A possible functional association between these two genes could be related to protein regulation, as both genes are involved in processing and degradation of specific proteins."
AKT1*BNIP3,"Possible functional associations between AKT1 and BNIP3 include their roles in cell survival, apoptosis, and mitochondrial quality control. AKT1 plays a crucial role in metabolism, cell survival, growth, and angiogenesis, regulating multiple processes through the phosphorylation of downstream substrates. BNIP3 is involved in apoptosis induction, mitochondrial quality control, and calcium homeostasis, acting in concert with other proteins like BCL2. While AKT1 can promote cell survival and negatively regulate apoptosis, BNIP3 can mediate apoptosis in certain contexts, thus having opposite effects on cell survival."
CGRRF1*SFN,"Possible functional associations between CGRRF1 and SFN may arise from their interaction with protein partners. CGRRF1 is known to inhibit growth in various cell lines and interacts with proteins like EIF3E, EIF2S2, and EIF3C, while SFN functions as a 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease that degrades short DNA and RNA oligonucleotides and forms homodimers and homotetramers. Although their direct roles differ, both genes may participate in common regulatory pathways involving protein synthesis or cellular growth control."
SRP14*USP14,"SRP14 is a component of the signal recognition particle (SRP) complex, which mediates the cotranslational targeting of secretory and membrane proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). USP14 is a proteasome-associated deubiquitinase involved in the regeneration of ubiquitin at the proteasome and regulation of endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD). Although both SRP14 and USP14 are involved in distinct cellular processes, they may have a functional association in the context of protein targeting, processing, and degradation within the endoplasmic reticulum."
DRAP1*SNX7,"DRAP1 is involved in the repression of activated and basal transcription of class II genes by obstructing the formation of a transcription-competent complex. SNX7 plays a role in regulating endocytosis and intracellular trafficking, as well as autophagosome assembly with SNX4. There might be a functional association between these two genes related to the regulation of gene expression and intracellular trafficking processes."
COG7*EIF4G1,"Possible functional associations between COG7 and EIF4G1 may be related to their roles in protein synthesis and cellular localization. COG7 is involved in maintaining normal Golgi function and morphology, while EIF4G1 participates in mRNA recognition, unwinding, and ribosome recruitment. Thus, both genes contribute to essential cellular processes, including protein synthesis and intracellular transport."
CCDC85B*GALE,"CCDC85B plays a role in hepatitis delta virus (HDV) genomic replication and interacts with viral phosphoproteins, while GALE is involved in the reversible epimerization of UDP-glucose, UDP-galactose, and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, essential for galactose catabolism and glycoprotein synthesis. A possible functional association between these two genes may be in the viral replication process, where GALE's role in glycoprotein synthesis could affect the interactions CCDC85B has with HDV components."
CHEK1*DAXX,"CHEK1 and DAXX are functionally associated through their roles in cell cycle regulation, transcription repression, and apoptosis. CHEK1 is involved in promoting the S to G2/M phase transition and works as an endogenous repressor, while DAXX acts as a transcription corepressor and modulator of apoptosis involving TNFRSF6-dependent signaling. Both genes are interconnected through shared protein interactions, such as TP53 and ATM pathways, that influence cell cycle regulation and apoptosis."
