interaction,summary
ENOPH1*HINT1,Possible functional association: ENOPH1 is involved in thiamine metabolism while HINT1 is involved in purine nucleotide metabolism. They interact with each other indirectly through protein interactions. There is no known direct biological process linking these two genes.
GTDC1*STAP2,"Possible functional associations: GTDC1 and STAP2 may interact through protein kinase PTK6 and be involved in modulating acute-phase response and STAT3 activity in systemic inflammation.   GTDC1 is a transcriptional activator that interacts with MAP2K3 and MAP2K6, and interferes with NF-kappa-B activation through interaction with MAP3K7. STAP2 is a substrate of protein kinase PTK6 and interacts with PTK6 and CSF1R, potentially modulating acute-phase response and STAT3 activity in systemic inflammation. The shortest path between GTDC1 and STAP2 in the BioGRID protein interaction network involves several intermediate proteins, including APP and PTBP1, with potential implications in signaling processes and disease development."
ASH2L*H2AFV,"Possible functional associations between ASH2L and H2AFV involve their roles in transcriptional regulation through the recruitment of histone methyltransferase complexes to gene promoters, as both genes are components of various methyltransferase-containing complexes. Additionally, H2AFV may be involved in the formation of constitutive heterochromatin and may be required for proper chromosome segregation during cell division."
CTSL1*TESK1,"There is no known functional association between CTSL1 and TESK1 according to the BioGRID protein interaction network. CTSL1 is involved in cell cycle regulation through proteolytic processing of transcription factor CUX1, while TESK1 regulates cytoskeletal dynamics by phosphorylating cofilin and suppressing microtubule breakdown."
IGF2BP2*STUB1,"Possible functional associations between IGF2BP2 and STUB1 are currently unknown. IGF2BP2 is an RNA-binding protein that stabilizes target mRNAs, while STUB1 is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that targets misfolded chaperone substrates for degradation. These two genes may have distinct roles in cellular processes."
CAB39*LPGAT1,"There are no clear functional associations between CAB39 and LPGAT1 based on their known functions. CAB39 is involved in binding and activating STK11/LKB1, while LPGAT1 is involved in fatty acyl chain remodeling of glycerophospholipids. The shortest path between the two proteins in the BioGRID protein interaction network involves intermediate proteins and not direct interactions between CAB39 and LPGAT1."
GMEB2*WDR61,"Possible functional association between GMEB2 and WDR61 could be their involvement in transcriptional regulation and gene expression. GMEB2 is a trans-acting factor that binds to glucocorticoid modulatory elements, while WDR61 is a component of the PAF1 complex, involved in transcriptional elongation and histone modification. Both genes could interact in regulating the expression of shared target genes."
KDM5B*ZNF274,"Possible functional associations between KDM5B and ZNF274 include their interaction through the protein complex formed by SETDB1, TRIM28/KAP1, and ATRX, leading to transcriptional repression of zinc-finger coding genes and establishment of H3K9me3 at these regions. KDM5B also plays a role in histone demethylation and transcriptional corepression, while ZNF274 is a transcriptional repressor that specifically binds to the 3'-end of zinc-finger coding genes."
HMGA2*NUP85,Possible functional associations between HMGA2 and NUP85 could involve nuclear membrane organization and RNA export due to NUP85's role in nuclear pore complex assembly and maintenance. HMGA2 may play a role in this process through its interaction with NUP85 and other proteins involved in spindle assembly and transcriptional regulation.
CYCS*PRKCD,"Possible functional associations: CYCS plays a role in mitochondrial apoptosis and PRKCD has both pro- and anti-apoptotic functions depending on the cellular context. They may cooperate in regulating cell survival and death pathways. The shortest path between them in the BioGRID protein interaction network involves several proteins known to be involved in apoptosis, suggesting that they may act together in this process."
MFSD10*RHEB,"Possible functional associations between MFSD10 and RHEB are not immediately apparent based on their known roles as an organic anion transporter and activator of mTORC1 signaling, respectively. However, in the context of microbial infection and herpes simplex virus 1 protein UL12 interaction, MFSD10 and RHEB may be part of a larger cellular response to viral infection involving mTORC1 activation and apoptosis regulation."
DNM1L*SPTLC2,"Possible functional associations between DNM1L and SPTLC2 are unclear based on the provided context. DNM1L is involved in mitochondrial division and interacts with various proteins to regulate fission. SPTLC2 is a subunit of serine palmitoyltransferase, which catalyzes the first step in sphingolipid biosynthesis and may be important in adipogenesis."
RNPS1*SERPINE1,"Possible functional associations: RNPS1 is involved in splicing and RNA processing, while SERPINE1 is a serine protease inhibitor with roles in fibrinolysis, cell migration, and senescence. They may have a functional association in regulating alternative splicing or mRNA metabolism in cancer cells. The shortest path in the protein interaction network suggests potential indirect interactions through other proteins such as MYC and RAF1."
MBNL2*STAP2,"There are currently no known functional associations between MBNL2 and STAP2. MBNL2 mediates pre-mRNA alternative splicing regulation and is involved in myotonic dystrophy pathophysiology, while STAP2 may play a regulatory role in the acute-phase response in inflammation and modulate STAT3 activity."
DNM1L*HINT1,"Possible functional associations between DNM1L and HINT1 include involvement in mitochondrial fission and regulation of transcriptional activation. Both genes have interactions with components involved in these processes, such as BCL2L1 and CTNNB1. Additionally, DNM1L has been shown to interact with HINT1 directly in the BioGRID protein interaction network."
GTPBP8*PPIC,"There are no known direct functional associations between GTPBP8 and PPIC. GTPBP8 is involved in regulating GH signaling and interacts with JAK2, while PPIC catalyzes protein folding and interacts with PCNA."
GMEB2*LPGAT1,"Possible functional associations between GMEB2 and LPGAT1 in specific biological terms are currently unknown. GMEB2 is a trans-acting factor that binds to glucocorticoid modulatory elements, while LPGAT1 is a lysophospholipid acyltransferase involved in fatty acyl chain remodeling of glycerophospholipids in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. They have no known direct biological significance or interaction."
