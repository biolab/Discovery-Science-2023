KDM3A*SACM1L,"Possible functional associations: None can be inferred based solely on protein-protein interactions and gene function descriptions. Both genes are involved in different biological processes (histone demethylation and phosphatidylinositol metabolism).   KDM3A is a histone demethylase that specifically demethylates 'Lys-9' of histone H3, involved in hormone-dependent transcriptional activation, spermatogenesis, and obesity resistance. SACM1L is a phosphoinositide phosphatase that hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and interacts with TMEM39A, SEC23A, and SEC24A, and PLEKHA3 and VAPA and/or VAPB to form a ternary complex."
