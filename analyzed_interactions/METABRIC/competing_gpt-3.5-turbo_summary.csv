The shortest path between these genes in the BioGRID protein interaction network involves common interaction partners, including NPM1 and HSPA1A, which may suggest potential functional interactions."
DNM1L*SACM1L,"Possible functional association between DNM1L and SACM1L is their interaction with the endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondrial interface during mitochondrial fission. DNM1L inhibits peroxisomal division and helps in oligomerization to form membrane-associated tubules, while SACM1L is a phosphoinositide phosphatase that catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate."
CDKN1B*PCNA,"CDKN1B is an important regulator of cell cycle progression, while PCNA is an auxiliary protein involved in DNA replication and repair. Both genes are involved in cell proliferation and DNA repair processes, suggesting a possible functional association in maintaining genomic stability during cell division.
