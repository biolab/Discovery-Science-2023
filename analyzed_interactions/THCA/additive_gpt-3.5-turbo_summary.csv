interaction,summary
CEBPA*TP53,"Possible functional associations between CEBPA and TP53 include regulation of cell cycle, apoptosis, and transcriptional activation. CEBPA directly enhances ribosomal DNA transcription and induces G1 cell cycle arrest, while TP53 acts as a tumor suppressor by controlling a set of genes required for cell division and apoptosis induction. There is evidence for a protein-protein interaction between CEBPA and TP53 through NCOA6, MYC, NR3C1, AR, and ESR1."
PDLIM1*SLC25A14,"Possible functional associations between PDLIM1 and SLC25A14 could involve cell migration and motility, given that both genes have been shown to interact with proteins involved in these processes. PDLIM1 may also play a role in cytoskeletal organization and protein localization, while SLC25A14 is involved in mitochondrial function and calcium-dependent signaling."
EGFR*NDUFA3,"Possible functional association: EGFR and NDUFA3 are not known to have direct functional associations, but both play important roles in cellular respiration. EGFR is involved in signal transduction and is a key player in cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation, while NDUFA3 is an accessory subunit of mitochondrial complex I respiratory chain that transfers electrons from NADH to ubiquinone in the electron transport chain."
EIF4G1*SRP14,"Possible functional associations between EIF4G1 and SRP14 include regulating protein synthesis and targeting secretory and membrane proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum. As members of the eIF4F and SRP complexes, respectively, they have distinct but complementary functions in protein translation and trafficking."
BAG6*UQCR10,"Possible functional association: BAG6 mediates apoptosis and interactions with microbial infection, while UQCR10 is a component of the ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase and the mitochondrial electron transport chain. They may not have a direct functional association based on their known processes, but they both play a role in regulating cell death and energy production in cells."
BAG6*SRP14,"Possible functional associations between BAG6 and SRP14 could be related to apoptosis and protein targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum. BAG6 mediates ricin-induced apoptosis and interacts with bacterial and human proteins, while SRP14 is a component of the signal recognition particle complex that mediates cotranslational targeting of secretory and membrane proteins to the ER. The shortest path between these two genes in the BioGRID protein interaction network suggests that they may interact in the context of multiple protein-protein interactions."
BAG6*CCDC92,"Possible functional association between BAG6 and CCDC92 in TCGA-THCA may be related to protein degradation and innate immune response. BAG6 mediates apoptosis and interacts with proteins involved in microbial infection, while CCDC92 is an interferon-stimulated protein that inhibits ebolavirus replication and interacts with viral RNA-bound nucleocapsids. The shortest path in the BioGRID protein interaction network between BAG6 and CCDC92 involves several proteins involved in protein degradation, suggesting a possible link between these genes in this biological process."
BAG3*ID2,BAG3 is a co-chaperone for HSP70 and has anti-apoptotic activity. ID2 negatively regulates the activity of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors. There are no direct or obvious functional associations known between these two genes in specific biological terms.
BAG6*TMEM50A,"There are no clear functional associations between BAG6 and TMEM50A based on their known roles and interactions. BAG6 is involved in apoptosis and interacts with microbial proteins, while TMEM50A is a subunit of a mitochondrial enzyme involved in the catabolism of fatty acids and amino acids."
EPRS*PSMB1,"Possible functional associations between EPRS and PSMB1 include their involvement in protein homeostasis and degradation, with EPRS being part of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase multienzyme complex and PSMB1 being a non-catalytic component of the 20S core proteasome complex. The shortest path in the BioGRID protein interaction network suggests that they may interact indirectly through other proteins such as IKBKE and NELFCD."
BAG6*VPS28,"Possible functional associations between BAG6 and VPS28 are in the regulation of vesicular trafficking processes, as VPS28 is a component of the ESCRT-I complex involved in this process, and BAG6 interacts with TSG101, another component of the ESCRT-I complex. Additionally, BAG6 has been shown to mediate apoptosis in response to microbial infection."
EGFR*GNAS,"EGFR and GNAS have no known functional associations based on the provided context. EGFR acts as a receptor for hepatitis C virus and is involved in downstream signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation, migration, and survival. GNAS functions downstream of G protein-coupled receptors and is involved in pathways that regulate intracellular signaling and cAMP levels."
BAG6*GNAS,Possible functional associations between BAG6 and GNAS in TCGA-THCA cancer may involve apoptosis regulation (BAG6) and G protein-coupled receptor (GNAS) signaling pathways. Further investigation is required to establish their precise joint molecular mechanism in the progression and therapeutic management of thyroid cancer.
