interaction,summary
ITGB5*SDHB,"There is no clear functional association between ITGB5 and SDHB based on their known roles. ITGB5 is involved in microbial infection and acts as a receptor for adenovirus, while SDHB is involved in the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex II and interacts with the JC virus small t antigen. The protein interaction network and shortest paths between them in the BioGRID database suggest indirect potential influences on each other through intermediate genes."
PYGL*TSPAN3,"Possible functional associations between PYGL and TSPAN3 are unclear based solely on their biological roles. However, the protein interaction network suggests that they may indirectly interact through common interactors, such as TP53, which is involved in stress response and tumorigenesis."
ITGB5*TXLNA,"One possible functional association between ITGB5 and TXLNA is in intracellular vesicle traffic and potentially in calcium-dependent exocytosis in neuroendocrine cells, as suggested by the context. ITGB5 may also act as a receptor for adenovirus type C and interacts with adenovirus type C penton protein."
PPP2R5A*SHC1,"Possible functional associations between PPP2R5A and SHC1 could involve regulation of cell signaling pathways, including those initiated by activated growth factor receptors, such as KIT and KITLG/SCF, as well as downstream of the angiopoietin receptor TEK/TIE2. PPP2R5A is a subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which can modulate substrate selectivity and catalytic activity, while SHC1 acts as a signaling adapter that couples activated receptors to downstream signaling pathways."
NNT*SUCLG1,Possible functional associations between NNT and SUCLG1 could be related to the regulation of reactive oxygen species detoxification in the adrenal gland and succinyl-CoA metabolism in the citric acid cycle. The shortest path in the protein interaction network suggests potential physical interactions between them through chaperone proteins and the Wnt signaling pathway.
HEBP1*NNT,Possible functional associations between HEBP1 and NNT are not evident based on the provided information. HEBP1 may bind free porphyrinogens while NNT may play a role in transhydrogenation and reactive oxygen species detoxification.
HEBP1*VAPB,"Possible functional associations between HEBP1 and VAPB could be related to cellular homeostasis regulation and response to cellular stress, due to their involvement in calcium homeostasis, unfolded protein response, and potential interactions with viral proteins. They may also have a role in the removal of potentially toxic compounds, such as porphyrins, from cells."
PTPN6*ZFP36,"Possible functional associations between PTPN6 and ZFP36 include regulation of cellular signaling pathways and control of gene expression. PTPN6 modulates signaling by tyrosine-phosphorylated receptors, while ZFP36 negatively regulates HTLV-1 TAX-dependent transactivation of viral LTR promoter. The shortest path between these genes in the BioGRID protein interaction network involves multiple protein-protein interactions, including SAMD4B, FHL3, TRIP6, NCL, and PRRC2A."
LPGAT1*PPP2R5A,"Possible functional association: PPP2R5A is a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), while LPGAT1 is involved in fatty acid remodeling. PP2A is known to regulate lipid metabolism in the liver, so it's possible that LPGAT1 may be regulated by PPP2R5A in this process."
MYLK*NFKBIA,"MYLK and NFKBIA might have a functional association in the regulation of inflammation and immune response. MYLK is involved in the inflammatory response, airway hyperreactivity, and leukocyte diapedesis, while NFKBIA inhibits NF-kappa-B/REL complexes activity, promoting ubiquitination and degradation, enabling the dimeric RELA to translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription, which is relevant in immune and pro-inflammatory responses."
DENND2D*SERPINE1,"Possible functional associations between DENND2D and SERPINE1 could involve regulation of cellular migration and senescence, as well as potentially promoting or inhibiting the formation of blood clots. The shortest protein interaction path between these two genes involves several intermediate proteins, including LMNA which is involved in nuclear structure and function."
DENND2D*ZFP36,"Based on the available information, there are no clear functional associations between DENND2D and ZFP36 in specific biological terms. DENND2D is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that activates RAB9A and RAB9B, while ZFP36 negatively regulates HTLV-1 TAX-dependent transactivation of viral long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter and interacts with HTLV-1 TAX to inhibit its transactivation."
PPP2R5A*RFX5,"Possible functional associations between PPP2R5A and RFX5 may involve regulation of gene expression and transcriptional activity, as RFX5 is involved in activating transcription from class II MHC promoters while PPP2R5A modulates substrate selectivity and catalytic activity. The BioGRID protein interaction network suggests potential physical interactions between the two genes through intermediary proteins such as APC, GIGYF2, and TRIM25."
FOS*PTPN6,"Possible functional associations between FOS and PTPN6 may involve regulation of cell proliferation and signaling pathways. FOS is a nuclear phosphoprotein which regulates signal transduction and plays a critical role in skeletal development, while PTPN6 modulates signaling by tyrosine phosphorylated receptors and plays a key role in hematopoiesis. The shortest path between FOS and PTPN6 in the BioGRID protein interaction network involves SMAD3, ABL1, PSMC5, VARS, EGFR, suggesting potential involvement in TGF-beta-mediated transcription and regulation of kinase activity."
P4HA2*TSPAN6,"Possible functional associations between P4HA2 and TSPAN6 include regulation of DNA methylation patterns and transcriptional repression of tumor suppressor genes. P4HA2 catalyzes the formation of 4-hydroxyproline in collagens and other proteins, while TSPAN6 preferentially methylates hemimethylated DNA and associates with chromatin during G2 and M phases. These processes may contribute to the silencing of TSGs in cancer cells."
IFRD2*NDUFA3,"There is no clear functional association between IFRD2 and NDUFA3 based on the provided protein interaction network and context. IFRD2 is involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, while NDUFA3 is an accessory subunit in the mitochondrial respiratory chain."
NCK2*PYGL,"There are no clear functional associations between NCK2 and PYGL based on the given context, as they have different functions in different pathways. NCK2 is an adapter protein which associates with tyrosine-phosphorylated growth factor receptors, while PYGL is an allosteric enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in glycogen catabolism."
HTRA1*TIMM22,There is no known functional association between HTRA1 and TIMM22 at present. HTRA1 is a serine protease involved in the degradation of extracellular matrix proteins and regulation of TGF-beta signaling. TIMM22 is a component of the TIM22 complex involved in the import and insertion of multi-pass transmembrane proteins into the mitochondrial inner membrane.
