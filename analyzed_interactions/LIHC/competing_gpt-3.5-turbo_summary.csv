interaction,summary
ACBD3*SEC11A,"There are no clear functional associations between ACBD3 and SEC11A based on their known roles in viral replication and signal peptide cleavage, respectively. However, both genes are involved in processes occurring within membrane-bound cellular compartments, suggesting possible indirect interactions or shared regulatory mechanisms."
RRAGA*ZNF274,"Possible functional associations: RRAGA and ZNF274 may have a role in regulating transcription and chromatin structure. RRAGA may also be involved in TNF-alpha function and cellular response to microbial infection.          Based on the protein interaction network and context, it is possible that RRAGA and ZNF274 are involved in regulating the chromatin structure of zinc-finger coding genes. They may also have a potential role in cellular response to microbial infections."
ACOT9*ALAS1,"There is no clear functional association between ACOT9 and ALAS1, as they are involved in distinct biological processes. ACOT9 hydrolyzes acyl-CoAs to free fatty acids and CoASH, while ALAS1 catalyzes the condensation of succinyl-CoA and glycine to form aminolevulinic acid (ALA)."
DUSP11*SLC35A1,"Possible functional association: DUSP11 may regulate mRNA metabolism and interact with RNA-binding proteins, while SLC35A1 transports CMP-sialic acid into the Golgi apparatus. There is no clear biological connection between these two genes based on their known functions and interactions."
DFFA*SLC35A1,"Possible functional associations between DFFA and SLC35A1 are unclear based on the provided information. DFFA is an inhibitor of caspase-activated DNase, while SLC35A1 transports CMP-sialic acid into the Golgi apparatus. Both genes have different functions in different biological processes, and it is unclear how they may be related."
HPRT1*ZNF274,"Possible functional associations between HPRT1 and ZNF274 can be inferred from their shortest path interaction in the BioGRID protein network. HPRT1 is involved in purine nucleotide generation through the purine salvage pathway, while ZNF274 is a transcription repressor that specifically binds to the 3'-end of zinc-finger coding genes and recruits chromatin-modifying proteins. It is possible that ZNF274 plays a role in regulating the expression of HPRT1 or its downstream targets."
RRP12*TRIB1,"Possible functional associations: None evident based on protein interaction network and gene function descriptions.  RRP12 is involved in regulating the dynamics and assembly of the actin cytoskeleton, and may play a role in cell cycle regulation. TRIB1 is an adapter protein involved in protein degradation and regulates myeloid cell differentiation. No direct functional association between these two genes is apparent based on available information."
RHEB*TRIB1,"There is currently no known functional association between RHEB and TRIB1. RHEB activates mTORC1 signaling and plays a role in regulation of apoptosis, while TRIB1 acts as an adapter protein involved in protein degradation and regulates myeloid cell differentiation via COP1-binding domain."
BAG6*TJP1,"There is no clear functional association between BAG6 and TJP1 based on the provided context. BAG6 is involved in mediating ricin-induced apoptosis and interacts with L. pneumophila Lpg2160 and LegU1 proteins, while TJP1 is a scaffolding protein involved in linking tight junction transmembrane proteins to the actin cytoskeleton and regulating cell migration, podosome formation, and barrier formation."
SLC35A1*TBPL1,"Based on the provided context and their biological functions, there seems to be no direct functional associations between SLC35A1 and TBPL1. SLC35A1 is involved in sialic acid transport while TBPL1 mediates transcription of most ribosomal proteins and NF1."
NVL*SEC11A,"Possible functional associations between NVL and SEC11A are unclear based solely on their protein interactions and described functions. NVL is involved in telomerase activity and ribosomal biogenesis, while SEC11A is involved in cleaving signal peptides in nascent proteins during translocation to the endoplasmic reticulum lumen. Without more information, it is difficult to infer any specific biological processes where these two genes may function together."
DCTN6*ZNF274,"There is no clear functional association between DCTN6 and ZNF274. DCTN6 is part of the dynactin complex involved in molecular motor transport along microtubules, while ZNF274 is a transcription repressor that binds to specific regions of DNA."
