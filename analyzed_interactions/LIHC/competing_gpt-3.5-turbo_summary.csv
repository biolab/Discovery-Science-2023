interaction,summary
DCTN6*ZNF274,"There is no clear functional association between DCTN6 and ZNF274. DCTN6 is part of the dynactin complex involved in microtubule transport, while ZNF274 is a transcription repressor that recruits chromatin-modifying proteins."
SLC35A1*TBPL1,"Based on the provided context, there is no direct evidence for functional associations between SLC35A1 and TBPL1. SLC35A1 transports CMP-sialic acid and CMP between the cytosol and Golgi, whereas TBPL1 mediates the transcription of ribosomal proteins and NF1."
ACOT9*ALAS1,"There is no clear functional association between ACOT9 and ALAS1 in specific biological terms based on the provided context. ACOT9 is involved in regulating intracellular levels of acyl-CoAs, while ALAS1 catalyzes the formation of aminolevulinic acid."
ACBD3*SEC11A,"There is no clear functional association between ACBD3 and SEC11A in TCGA-LIHC cancer type based on their known biological roles. ACBD3 plays a role in viral RNA replication and interacts with various picornaviruses, while SEC11A is involved in catalyzing the cleavage of N-terminal signal sequences from nascent proteins during translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum."
RRAGA*ZNF274,"Possible functional association between RRAGA and ZNF274 is their interaction through the BioGRID protein interaction network. RRAGA may play a role in cellular death during microbial infection, while ZNF274 is a transcription repressor that recruits chromatin-modifying proteins and interacts with ATRX to establish or maintain/protect H3K9me3 at transcriptionally active regions of zinc-finger coding genes."
DFFA*SLC35A1,"There is no clear functional association between DFFA and SLC35A1 based on their roles in different biological processes. DFFA is involved in inhibiting the caspase-activated DNase, while SLC35A1 transports CMP-sialic acid into the Golgi apparatus."
RHEB*TRIB1,"Possible functional association: TRIB1 may play a role in protein degradation by interacting with RHEB's binding partner, mTORC1. RHEB, in turn, activates the protein kinase activity of mTORC1 and regulates apoptosis, macrophage differentiation, and the phosphorylation of S6K1 and EIF4EBP1 through mTORC1 signaling."
BAG6*TJP1,"There is no clear functional association between BAG6 and TJP1 based on the provided context and their known biological roles. BAG6 is involved in mediating ricin-induced apoptosis and has interaction with L. pneumophila Lpg2160 and LegU1 proteins, while TJP1 acts as a scaffolding protein for tight junctions, necessary for lumenogenesis, cell migration, and barrier formation."
DUSP11*SLC35A1,"Possible functional associations: DUSP11 and SLC35A1 are not known to have direct functional associations but they are connected by the RNA helicase DDX39A in the BioGRID protein interaction network. DUSP11 possesses RNA 5'-triphosphatase and diphosphatase activities and may participate in nuclear mRNA metabolism, while SLC35A1 transports CMP-sialic acid from the cytosol into the Golgi apparatus."
NVL*SEC11A,"There is no clear biological pathway suggesting a direct functional association between NVL and SEC11A. NVL is involved in telomerase activity and 60S ribosomal subunit biogenesis, while SEC11A is part of the signal peptidase complex which catalyzes the cleavage of N-terminal signal sequences from nascent proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum."
HPRT1*ZNF274,"Possible functional association: ZNF274 may recruit HPRT1-containing complexes to the 3'-ends of zinc-finger coding genes, leading to generation of purine nucleotides and transcriptional repression. HPRT1 may play a role in establishing/maintaining H3K9me3 at these regions."
RRP12*TRIB1,"RRP12 and TRIB1 are functionally associated in the protein degradation pathways via their interaction with COP1 ubiquitin ligase. RRP12 also plays a role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton and cell cycle progression, while TRIB1 regulates myeloid cell differentiation and MAP kinase activation."
