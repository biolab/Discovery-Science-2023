FAM20B*UBL5,"Possible functional associations between FAM20B and UBL5 include their involvement in protein folding and regulation of cellular processes such as glycosaminoglycan-protein linkage and telomere maintenance. While there is no direct evidence of their interaction, they both interact with the protein DDX39B, suggesting a potential involvement in RNA metabolism."
EPRS*HSPB1,"Possible functional associations between EPRS and HSPB1 in TCGA-KIRP could be related to their roles in stress response and protein folding. EPRS is part of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase multienzyme complex, while HSPB1 functions as a molecular chaperone. It is possible that EPRS and HSPB1 work together to ensure proper protein folding and stress resistance in TCGA-KIRP."

CAMSAP2*HSPB1,"Possible functional association: CAMSAP2 and HSPB1 may have a role in regulating microtubule dynamics and organization. CAMSAP2 specifically binds to the minus-end of non-centrosomal microtubules and regulates their stabilization, organization of cellular organelles, neuronal polarity and development. HSPB1 functions as a molecular chaperone in maintaining denatured proteins in a folding-competent state and may regulate numerous biological processes, including the axonal transport of neurofilament proteins."
HSPB1*KHDRBS1,"One possible functional association between HSPB1 and KHDRBS1 may be in their roles in stress response and cellular organization. Specifically, HSPB1 is a molecular chaperone that maintains denatured proteins in a folding-competent state, while KHDRBS1 has been shown to self-associate and form homooligomers in response to stress and play a role in RNA substrate specificity modulation. Their interaction via a shortest path in the BioGRID protein interaction network suggests a potential regulatory relationship in these processes."
ATF6*HSPB1,"Possible functional associations: ATF6 is a transcription factor involved in the unfolded protein response during ER stress, while HSPB1 is a small heat shock protein that functions as a molecular chaperone. There could be a possible association between these genes in maintaining protein folding competence during stress response."

These genes may play roles in regulating protein degradation and/or cellular signaling pathways.          Specific gene function: PIH1D1 mediates interaction of TELO2 with the R2TP complex, enhances pre-rRNA transcription, and recruits the SWI/SNF complex to the core promoter of rRNA genes. PSMG1 promotes assembly of the 20S proteasome as a heterodimer with PSMG2."
