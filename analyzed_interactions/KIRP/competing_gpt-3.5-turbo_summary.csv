The shortest interaction path between the two proteins in the BioGRID network may suggest a potential physical interaction."
PIK3C3*SMC3,"Possible functional associations between PIK3C3 and SMC3 in TCGA-KIRP cancer type are not immediately clear from the provided context. PIK3C3 is involved in the PI3K complex and plays a role in SARS-CoV-2 replication, while SMC3 is a component of the cohesin complex required for chromosome cohesion during cell division. Further investigation is needed to explore any potential biological connections between these two genes in TCGA-KIRP."
FOXO4*PRKX,"Possible functional association: FOXO4 and PRKX might be involved in regulating cellular differentiation and morphogenesis in renal epithelial cells through interactions with SMAD6 and PKD1.          FOXO4 is a transcription factor that regulates the insulin signaling pathway, suppresses cell cycle, and increases proteasome activity in embryonic stem cells. PRKX is a cAMP-dependent protein kinase involved in cellular differentiation and epithelial morphogenesis. The shortest path between FOXO4 and PRKX in the BioGRID protein interaction network involves XPO1, which might facilitate the nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of these proteins."
TIPARP*TMEM50A,"There is no clear functional association between TIPARP and TMEM50A based on their known biological roles. TIPARP is an ADP-ribosyltransferase and negative regulator of AHR, while TMEM50A is a subunit of the biotin-dependent propionyl-CoA carboxylase involved in fatty acid catabolism."
SLC11A2*YME1L1,"There is currently no known direct functional association between SLC11A2 and YME1L1. SLC11A2 is involved in metal ion transport and iron homeostasis, while YME1L1 is an ATP-dependent metalloprotease that regulates mitochondrial morphology and function."
MAPK9*PIK3R3,"MAPK9 and PIK3R3 have a functional association in the TCGA-KIRP cancer type, as they are connected through a protein interaction network. MAPK9, also known as JNK2, is involved in the JNK signaling pathway and can phosphorylate POU5F1, while PIK3R3 binds to activated protein-tyrosine kinases through its SH2 domain. The biological significance of their interaction in cancer development warrants further investigation."
FAM20B*PIK3C3,"Possible functional associations between FAM20B and PIK3C3 include their involvement in the regulation of glycosaminoglycan-protein linkage region synthesis and PI3K (PI3KC3/PI3K-III/class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) complex formation, respectively. FAM20B is responsible for 2-O-phosphorylation of xylose in the linkage region, which may influence the catalytic activity of B3GAT3. PIK3C3 is a catalytic subunit of the PI3K complex and is required for SARS-CoV-2 replication. The shortest path between these two genes in the BioGRID protein interaction network includes intermediate nodes Parkin and TRIM67."
MSH6*PIK3C3,"Possible functional associations between MSH6 and PIK3C3 include involvement in DNA repair processes and regulation of the PI3K signaling pathway. MSH6 is a component of the post-replicative DNA mismatch repair system, while PIK3C3 is part of the core PI3K complex. It is plausible that their interaction may play a role in coordinating DNA repair with signaling events mediated by PI3K."
ENOPH1*PIK3R3,"Possible functional association: ENOPH1 and PIK3R3 may interact through ERBB3 and regulate insulin signaling and kinase activity in TCGA-KIRP.  ENOPH1 is involved in the biosynthesis of methionine and cysteine while PIK3R3 binds to activated protein-tyrosine kinases and regulates their kinase activity. ERBB3 is involved in insulin stimulation and AXL is a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in various signaling pathways. Together, these genes may play a role in regulating insulin signaling and kinase activity in TCGA-KIRP."
EPB41L2*MPZL1,"EPB41L2 and MPZL1 have a potential functional association as they are connected in the BioGRID protein interaction network through multiple shortest paths, suggesting they may participate in common signaling pathways or biological processes. EPB41L2 is involved in cell division and mitotic spindle organization, whereas MPZL1 is a cell surface receptor involved in signal transduction and regulation of cell motility."
PPIC*RAB11FIP2,It is possible that PPIC and RAB11FIP2 may functionally associate in regulating membrane trafficking and vesicle transport. PPIC is involved in protein folding and interacts with PCNA while RAB11FIP2 is a Rab11 effector that regulates vesicle transport from the endosomal recycling compartment to the plasma membrane and plays a role in receptor-mediated endocytosis.
INSIG1*PIK3C3,"INSIG1 is involved in the negative regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis by mediating the retention of SCAP-SREBP complex in the endoplasmic reticulum and degradation of HMGCR. PIK3C3 encodes the catalytic subunit of PI3K complex III, involved in autophagy and microbial infection. There is no known direct functional association between these genes, but some of their processes may overlap, such as their role in endoplasmic reticulum function."
FOXO3*IDE,"FOXO3 is involved in various cellular processes such as apoptosis, autophagy, post-transcriptional regulation of MYC, and regulation of chondrogenic commitment of skeletal progenitor cells. IDE acts as an entry receptor for varicella-zoster virus. There doesn't seem to be a clear functional association between these two genes based on their currently known roles in biological processes."
EPRS*SLC11A2,"Possible functional associations between EPRS and SLC11A2 could involve iron homeostasis and metabolism. EPRS can promote the uptake of long-chain fatty acids by adipocytes, while SLC11A2 enables Fe(2+) and Mn(2+) ion entry into mitochondria, promoting mitochondrial heme synthesis and iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis. The shortest path in the BioGRID network between these genes involves several intermediate proteins with diverse functions, making direct functional associations unclear."
GPC1*TSPAN4,"Possible functional associations between GPC1 and TSPAN4 include their interaction in the protein network and their involvement in cell surface signaling, cell adhesion, and immune response processes. They may also play roles in cancer biology, as GPC1 has been implicated in tumor growth and TSPAN4 is involved in platelet activation, which can promote metastasis."
CDKN1A*USP7,CDKN1A (also known as p21) inhibits cyclin-dependent kinase activity and promotes DNA damage-induced G2 arrest. USP7 stabilizes the herpesvirus 1 trans-acting transcriptional protein ICP0/VMW110 during HSV-1 infection and interacts with innate immune signaling proteins TRAF3 and TRAF6. There is a possible functional association between these two genes as USP7 is found in the shortest path between CDKN1A and plays a role in DNA damage response.
CASK*RASA1,"Possible functional associations between CASK and RASA1 in TCGA-KIRP cancer type are not immediately apparent from the given context and interaction network. CASK is a scaffolding protein involved in synaptic protein anchoring and trafficking, while RASA1 is an inhibitory regulator of the Ras-cyclic AMP pathway."
RAB27A*TIPARP,"There is no readily apparent functional association between RAB27A and TIPARP based on their individual roles in endocytic pathway regulation and ADP-ribosylation, respectively. However, the identified protein interactions in the BioGRID network suggest that they may be involved in cytotoxic granule exocytosis and possibly immunologic synapse formation."
