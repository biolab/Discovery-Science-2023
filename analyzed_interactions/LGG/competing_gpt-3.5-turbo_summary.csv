CTNNAL1*RNMT,"Possible functional associations between CTNNAL1 and RNMT are unclear based on the provided information. CTNNAL1 may modulate the Rho pathway signaling and interact with ARHGEF1 while RNMT is a catalytic subunit of the mRNA-capping methyltransferase RNMT:RAMAC complex that methylates the N7 position of added guanosine to the 5'-cap structure of mRNAs, binds RNA, and interacts with importin alpha and elongating form of polymerase II."
ELAVL1*KDM5B,"ELAVL1 and KDM5B do not have any known functional associations in the literature. ELAVL1 is an RNA-binding protein that stabilizes mRNAs, while KDM5B is a histone demethylase that plays a central role in the histone code. ELAVL1 is involved in embryonic stem cell differentiation and MYC mRNA stability, while KDM5B is implicated in the proliferation of breast cancer cells and may act as a tumor suppressor in melanoma."
CDK4*CHMP6,"Possible functional associations between CDK4 and CHMP6 may be related to cell cycle regulation and endosomal protein sorting, respectively. As CDK4 is a key regulator of G1/S transition and CHMP6 is a core component of the ESCRT-III complex involved in multivesicular body formation and sorting of endosomal cargo proteins, they may play roles in regulating protein trafficking and degradation during cell cycle progression."
PSME1*PSME2,"PSME1 and PSME2 are involved in immunoproteasome assembly and required for efficient antigen processing. As a heterodimer, they form a hexameric ring. There is a direct interaction between these two genes, suggesting they may work together in these processes."
PIP4K2B*RRP1B,"Possible functional associations: PIP4K2B and RRP1B may be functionally associated in the context of influenza A virus infection as RRP1B interacts with the viral nucleoprotein NP and with RNA-directed RNA polymerase subunits PB1 and PB2, while PIP4K2B negatively regulates insulin signaling and interacts with PIP5Ks to suppress PIP5K-mediated conversion to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. However, further experimental evidence is required to establish a definitive functional association between these two genes."
MSH6*SMARCC1,"MSH6 and SMARCC1 may have a functional association in DNA repair and chromatin remodeling. MSH6 is involved in DNA mismatch repair, while SMARCC1 is part of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, which alters DNA-histone contacts. In addition, SMARCC1 has been shown to interact with MMR proteins, suggesting a possible role in coordinating chromatin remodeling with DNA repair."
FOXJ3*NR3C1,"Based on their known functions, there are no obvious functional associations between FOXJ3 and NR3C1. FOXJ3 is involved in muscle fiber type identity, spermatogenesis, and interacts with G-actin and capping protein. NR3C1 has transcriptional repression and activation activity, binds to DNA, and interacts with several coactivator complexes and chaperones. However, it is possible that they may indirectly interact through shared pathways or protein partners."
EZH2*SOX4,"EZH2 and SOX4 have a shortest path of protein interactions in the BioGRID network, suggesting a potential functional association in cellular processes. EZH2 is a Polycomb group protein involved in histone methylation and transcriptional repression, while SOX4 is a transcriptional activator required for Vgamma2-positive gamma-delta T-cell maturation and skeletal myoblast differentiation."
APOE*NFKBIB,"Possible functional associations between APOE and NFKBIB could involve regulation of immune response and inflammation. APOE plays a role in viral infection while NFKBIB inhibits NF-kappa-B, a transcription factor involved in inflammation and immune response. The shortest path in the protein interaction network suggests possible protein-protein interactions between APOE and NFKBIB through other proteins involved in transcription or signaling processes."
PUM2*SNX13,"It is unclear based on the provided context if PUM2 and SNX13 have any direct functional association. However, PUM2 is a sequence-specific RNA-binding protein that acts as a post-transcriptional repressor, while SNX13 may be involved in intracellular trafficking and acts as a GAP for Galphas during microbial infection."
CCNE2*KDM5B,"CCNE2 and KDM5B are functionally associated as they are connected in the BioGRID protein interaction network through KIF14. CCNE2 controls the cell cycle at late G1 and early S phase through interaction with CDK2 and CDK3, while KDM5B is a histone demethylase that plays a central role in the histone code and acts as a transcriptional corepressor and/or tumor suppressor."
ELAVL1*TCERG1,"Possible functional association: ELAVL1 binds to mRNA, increasing their stability, while TCERG1 regulates transcription elongation of RNA polymerase II. It is possible that ELAVL1 may stabilize TCERG1 mRNA, leading to an increase in TCERG1 expression and potentially affecting its transcriptional regulation role."
ABL1*MSH6,"ABL1 and MSH6 are involved in distinct biological processes. ABL1 is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase involved in cell growth, survival, and DNA damage response, while MSH6 is a component of the DNA mismatch repair system. There may be functional associations in the context of DNA damage response and potentially in homologous recombination repair."
NNT*NR3C1,"Possible functional associations between NNT and NR3C1 may involve NNT's role in reactive oxygen species detoxification in the adrenal gland and NR3C1's role in transcriptional activation and repression, suggesting a potential connection between oxidative stress and gene expression regulation."
ELAVL1*HDAC2,"Possible functional association: HDAC2 is involved in transcriptional regulation through histone deacetylation, while ELAVL1 stabilizes mRNAs. They may both play a role in regulating gene expression and potentially interact in the regulation of specific genes important in cancer development or progression."
KDM5B*RRP1B,"Possible functional associations: KDM5B and RRP1B have a shortest path of protein interactions that go through MYC, which is a transcription factor involved in cell growth and proliferation. KDM5B is a histone demethylase that controls gene expression, while RRP1B plays a role in promoting viral mRNA transcription and interacts with the influenza A virus nucleoprotein. There is no direct biological evidence for a functional association between these two genes."
BIRC2*USP7,"Possible functional association: BIRC2 and USP7 both play a role in regulating apoptosis/cell death and inflammation signaling. BIRC2 is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that regulates NF-kappa-B signaling, while USP7 stabilizes proteins involved in antiviral and innate immune signaling. There may be a potential regulatory interaction between these genes through their involvement in these pathways."
KDM5B*PDS5A,"Possible functional association between KDM5B and PDS5A could involve regulating sister chromatid cohesion in mitosis and DNA replication. KDM5B acts as a transcriptional corepressor for FOXG1B and PAX9 and favors breast cancer cell proliferation, whereas PDS5A interacts with the cohesin complex and TP63, playing a role in accurate chromosome partitioning in both meiotic and mitotic cells."
KDM5A*KDM5B,"KDM5A and KDM5B are both histone demethylases that play roles in histone code and gene transcription regulation. There are several interactions between KDM5A and KDM5B in the BioGRID protein interaction network, suggesting that they may functionally associate with each other in the regulation of specific genes."
