KDM5A*KDM5B,"KDM5A and KDM5B are histone demethylases that regulate specific gene transcription by removing methyl groups from histone H3 at the lysine-4 position. They also interact with other proteins, such as RB1, MYC, HDAC1, and FOXG1B, to regulate transcriptional activity and proliferation of cancer cells. Their shortest interaction path is through LMO2, RB1, EZH2, HDAC2, and HDAC1. There are possible functional associations between these two genes in the regulation of histone code and the circadian rhythm, as KDM5A acts as a coactivator of CLOCK-BMAL1-mediated transcriptional activation of PER1/2 genes and increases histone acetylation at PER1/2 promoters by inhibiting HDAC1 activity. Meanwhile, KDM5B represses the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer-mediated transcriptional activation of the core clock component PER2."

SOX4 is a transcriptional activator that plays a role in T-cell development and skeletal myoblast differentiation. Given their roles in transcriptional regulation, it is possible that they may have opposing effects on gene expression and potentially regulate similar pathways in different ways."
CDK4*CHMP6,"Possible functional association: CDK4 is a kinase that regulates the cell-cycle during G(1)/S transition, while CHMP6 is a component of the endosomal sorting required for transport complex III (ESCRT-III) which is involved in multivesicular bodies (MVBs) formation and sorting of endosomal cargo proteins into MVBs. It is possible that CHMP6 could be involved in the regulation of CDK4-mediated cell cycle progression."
PSME1*PSME2,"PSME1 and PSME2 form a heterodimeric ring and are involved in immunoproteasome assembly and efficient antigen processing. They are both members of the PA28 activator complex, which enhances class I binding peptide generation by altering the proteasome cleavage pattern. Therefore, it is likely that they work together to regulate antigen processing."
PUM2*SNX13,"There is no obvious functional association between PUM2 and SNX13 based on their known biological roles. PUM2 is involved in post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA targets, while SNX13 is involved in intracellular trafficking and may play a role in endosome homeostasis. The shortest path between these two genes in the BioGRID protein interaction network is through TRIM25, which has a role in the innate immune response and may be involved in regulating protein ubiquitination."
