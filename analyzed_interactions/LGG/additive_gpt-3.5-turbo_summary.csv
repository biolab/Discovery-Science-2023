interaction,summary
GRB10*HMG20B,"There is no clear functional association between GRB10 and HMG20B, as they do not share direct protein interaction partners or pathways. GRB10 is an adapter protein that modulates cell surface receptor kinase signaling, while HMG20B is required for cell cycle progression and acts as a component of a histone deacetylase complex."
P4HA2*SRSF4,"Possible functional association: P4HA2 is involved in collagen formation, while SRSF4 plays a role in alternative splice site selection during pre-mRNA splicing. There is no obvious connection between the two genes based on their known functions."
APOE*UBE2E1,"Possible functional associations: APOE is involved in microbial infection, including interaction with hepatitis C virus envelope glycoprotein E2, while UBE2E1 accepts ubiquitin and catalyzes its covalent attachment to other proteins, including the selective degradation of short-lived and abnormal proteins. There may be a functional association between these genes in regulating the response to viral infection or protein degradation pathways."
PNKP*RAD51C,"Possible functional associations: PNKP and RAD51C are both involved in DNA repair pathways, specifically non-homologous end-joining and homologous recombination, respectively. They interact with other DNA repair proteins, such as XRCC4 and BRCA2, and may have a role in mitochondrial DNA copy number regulation and centrosome maintenance. There may be a functional association between PNKP and RAD51C in the response to DNA damage and repair processes."
APOE*UBQLN2,"Possible functional association between APOE and UBQLN2 could be their involvement in autophagy and protein degradation. APOE plays a role in viral infection and interacts with HCV while UBQLN2 plays a crucial role in protein degradation mechanisms and pathways. The shortest path between APOE and UBQLN2 in the BioGRID protein interaction network involves proteins involved in endocytosis and autophagy such as EPN2, pointing towards a possible functional association in autophagy."
HMG20B*P4HA2,"One possible functional association between HMG20B and P4HA2 is their involvement in regulating the cell cycle and extracellular matrix formation, respectively. The interaction of HMG20B with P4HA2 in the BioGRID network suggests a potential connection between these processes."
DPH2*P4HA2,"Possible functional associations between DPH2 and P4HA2 could be in the post-translational modification and synthesis of proteins, specifically with regards to the formation of -Xaa-Pro-Gly- sequences in collagens and the transfer of an ACP group to a histidine residue."
MFSD10*SNX13,"Based on the context provided, there are no clear functional associations between MFSD10 and SNX13. MFSD10 is a transporter for organic anions while SNX13 may be involved in intracellular trafficking and acts as a GAP for Galphas. However, they both interact with proteins from microbial infections."
FBXL12*KLHL21,"There is no clear biological reason for a functional association between FBXL12 and KLHL21. FBXL12 acts as a substrate-recognition component of an SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, while KLHL21 is a substrate-specific adapter of a BCR E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex. They have different functions and are not known to interact directly in any biological processes."
IGFBP3*MUC1,"MUC1 promotes tumor progression and regulates TP53-mediated transcription, whereas IGFBP3 exhibits IGF-independent antiproliferative and apoptotic effects. The interaction between IGFBP3 and MUC1 may modulate cell signaling, particularly in the ERK, SRC, and NF-kappa-B pathways."
RFC5*TP53,"Possible functional associations between RFC5 and TP53 could be in DNA replication and repair processes as RFC5 is involved in the elongation of primed DNA templates and requires the action of PCNA while TP53 is a tumor suppressor gene involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis induction, which can be triggered by DNA damage. The shortest path between the two genes in the BioGRID protein interaction network also supports this possible association."
APOE*MRPS16,"There is no clear functional association between APOE and MRPS16 based on the provided context. APOE is involved in facilitating microbial infection, while MRPS16 is a component of the mitochondrial small ribosomal subunit and acts as a cell-surface receptor for cytokine KITLG/SCF."
APOE*PAFAH1B2,"Possible functional association between APOE and PAFAH1B2 could be related to lipid metabolism and viral infections. APOE is known to interact with HCV envelope glycoprotein E2 and modulate the assembly, maturation, and infectivity of HCV viral particles. PAFAH1B2 is a catalytic subunit of PAF-AH (I) enzyme that hydrolyzes PAF and its analogs, modulating the action of PAF. It may also play a role in male germ cell meiosis and early spermiogenesis."
SQSTM1*USP1,"Possible functional association: SQSTM1 and USP1 both play roles in DNA damage repair. SQSTM1 is involved in autophagy, while USP1 is a negative regulator of DNA repair by deubiquitinating FANCD2 and PCNA. They may interact in PCNA-mediated translesion synthesis."
DNTTIP2*NFATC4,"Possible functional associations:  NFATC4 is involved in immune system function, T-cell activation, transcription of cytokine genes, and BDNF-driven pro-survival signaling. DNTTIP2 is involved in regulating transcriptional activity of genes like DNTT and ESR1, and in protein remodeling in ribosome biogenesis. The shortest path between them suggests they potentially interact through the protein APEX1, but without further context, it is difficult to predict any specific functional associations between them."
APOE*MYC,"Possible functional associations between APOE and MYC include their involvement in cancer progression. APOE is involved in HCV infection and lipid metabolism while MYC is a transcription factor that activates the transcription of growth-related genes and regulates somatic reprogramming. They both play a role in cellular processes such as angiogenesis and splicing regulation, which may contribute to cancer development and progression."
MTX2*TMEM109,"There is no clear functional association between MTX2 and TMEM109 based on their known biology and protein interactions. MTX2 is involved in mitochondrial protein transport and interacts with the MICOS complex, while TMEM109 may protect against DNA damage and form voltage-gated calcium and potassium channels."
