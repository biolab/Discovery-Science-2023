DCTD provides nucleotide substrate for thymidylate synthetase while TM9SF2 forms a homohexamer ring structure that requires ATP binding, and is a component of the Clp complex formed by two CLPP heptameric rings and two CLPX hexameric rings."
HSPD1*PSME1,"Possible functional associations between HSPD1 and PSME1 include their interaction in the immunoproteasome assembly, where PSME1 is required for efficient antigen processing and HSPD1 acts as a chaperone to assist in the correct folding of imported proteins in the mitochondrial matrix. They may also be involved in cellular stress response and the prevention of misfolding and promotion of refolding of unfolded polypeptides."
SMC4*TCERG1,"Possible functional association: SMC4 and TCERG1 have protein-protein interactions, suggesting potential roles in regulating transcription elongation and chromatin condensation during mitosis.   SMC4 is a central component of the condensin complex, required for conversion of chromatin into mitotic-like condense chromosomes. TCERG1 is a transcription factor that binds RNA polymerase II and inhibits transcript elongation from target genes. These genes may cooperate in regulating chromatin structure and transcription elongation."
SPDEF*UGDH,"Possible functional associations between SPDEF and UGDH could involve the regulation of glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis, given that UGDH is required for this process, and SPDEF has been implicated in prostate cancer development and transcriptional activation of SERPINB5 promoter. However, more research is needed to determine the specific nature of their relationship."
NFKB2*PMAIP1,"Possible functional associations between NFKB2 and PMAIP1 include regulation of apoptosis and promotion of proteasomal degradation of MCL1. NFKB2 is a transcription factor involved in inflammation, immunity, differentiation, and tumorigenesis, while PMAIP1 promotes mitochondrial membrane changes and efflux of apoptogenic proteins."
SMC3*USP16,"Possible functional associations between SMC3 and USP16 could involve cohesin-mediated chromosome cohesion during the cell cycle and histone H2A deubiquitination, which is a prerequisite for subsequent phosphorylation at Ser-11 of histone H3 during chromosomal segregation in mitosis. However, there is no direct evidence linking these two processes."
PRKACA*TGFBR2,"Possible functional associations: PRKACA phosphorylates and activates ABL1 in sperm flagellum to promote spermatozoa capacitation; TGFBR2 binds TGFB1, TGFB2 and TGFB3 in the picomolar affinity range without the participation of additional receptors and blocks activation of SMAD2 and SMAD3 by TGFB1 homodimer. There are no known direct functional associations between the two genes. The shortest path between PRKACA and TGFBR2 in the BioGRID protein interaction network suggests that they are indirectly linked through multiple intermediary proteins."

Both CDK7 and ETS1 are also involved in DNA damage response."
PIN1*TCEA2,"One possible functional association between PIN1 and TCEA2 is their involvement in RNA polymerase II transcription elongation. PIN1 is a peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase that regulates mitosis and can transactivate multiple oncogenes, while TCEA2 is necessary for efficient transcription elongation past template-encoded arresting sites and interacts with the basal transcription factor GTF2B. The shortest path between these two genes in the BioGRID protein interaction network involves several intermediate proteins, suggesting a potential indirect interaction."

AURKA*RALA,"AURKA is a mitotic serine/threonine kinase involved in various mitotic events, as well as regulating the p53/TP53 pathway and microtubule remodeling. RALA is a multifunctional GTPase involved in gene expression, cell migration, cell proliferation, and membrane trafficking. Possible functional associations between these two could be related to their role in mitosis through their interaction in the BioGRID protein interaction network."
CENPO*PMPCB,"There are no clear functional associations between CENPO and PMPCB based on their individual roles in kinetochore assembly and mitochondrial protein processing, respectively. However, the possibility of indirect interactions between these genes through the protein interaction network suggests further investigation."
MLLT11*PACSIN3,"Possible functional association: MLLT11 and PACSIN3 may be involved in endocytosis and regulation of internalization of plasma membrane proteins. MLLT11 interacts with HSPA8 and LAMP2A which may target it for degradation via chaperone-mediated autophagy. PACSIN3 plays a role in the internalization of SLC2A1/GLUT1 and TRPV4 and interacts with DNM1, SYNJ1 and WASL."

BIRC5 is involved in mitosis and cytokinesis through its participation in the chromosome passage protein complex, while POLE2 is an accessory subunit of DNA polymerase epsilon complex that participates in chromosomal DNA replication and repair."
MBNL2*TM9SF2,"There is no clear biological association between MBNL2 and TM9SF2 based on their known functions and interactions. MBNL2 is involved in pre-mRNA alternative splicing regulation and interacts with ITGA3, while TM9SF2 functions as a channel or small molecule transporter and interacts with TFAM in intracellular compartments. The shortest protein interaction path between them in the BioGRID network involves PARK2."
HDGFRP3*PIN1,"HDGFRP3 and PIN1 have a direct protein-protein interaction according to the BioGRID network. PIN1 is a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase that regulates mitosis, cell transformation, and JNK cascade, while HDGFRP3 enhances DNA synthesis and may play a role in cell proliferation, potentially suggesting a functional association in cell cycle regulation."
CCNA2*HMGA2,"Possible functional associations between CCNA2 and HMGA2 include their involvement in cell cycle regulation and chromosome condensation. CCNA2 is a cyclin that controls both the G1/S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle, while HMGA2 functions as a transcriptional regulator and can positively regulate CCNA2 expression. The shortest path between CCNA2 and HMGA2 in the BioGRID protein interaction network includes several other genes involved in cell cycle regulation, further suggesting a potential functional association."

However, without further experimental evidence, specific biological terms for their functional association cannot be determined with complete certainty."
CCND3*ETS1,"CCND3 regulates cell cycle progression through G1/S transition, while ETS1 binds DNA as a homodimer and acts as a dominant-negative. The shortest path between CCND3 and ETS1 in the BioGRID protein interaction network suggests that they interact indirectly through APP and CREBBP, which could potentially modulate transcriptional activity or cell cycle regulation."
DAXX*ETS1,"Possible functional associations between DAXX and ETS1 include the regulation of transcriptional activity and the mediation of apoptotic pathways. DAXX acts as a transcription corepressor and inhibits the transcriptional activation of ETS1, while ETS1 acts as a homodimer that binds to DNA and requires homodimerization for transcription activation. They both interact with other proteins, including MAPI and SP100, which may modulate their transcriptional activity."
ORC1*PMPCB,"Possible functional association between ORC1 and PMPCB could be related to the regulation of DNA replication and mitochondrial protein processing, respectively. They can have indirect interactions through other proteins in the BioGRID network, but their direct biological connection is unclear."
SSBP2*STAT3,"Possible functional associations: SSBP2 may play a role in inhibiting dephosphorylation of ERK and mediating survival, while STAT3 mediates cellular responses to growth factors, regulates inflammatory response, and plays a role in basal beta cell functions. There may be a potential interaction between these two genes in regulating cell survival and response to stress."
