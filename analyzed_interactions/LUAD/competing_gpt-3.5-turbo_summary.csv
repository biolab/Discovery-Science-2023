interaction,summary
HNRNPA2B1*PRKACA,"Possible functional association: HNRNPA2B1 and PRKACA may be involved in RNA transport and metabolism, as well as cell signaling pathways related to regulation of gene expression and cell cycle progression. HNRNPA2B1 is involved in transporting HIV-1 genomic RNA out of the nucleus, while PRKACA activates cAMP-sensitive protein kinase pathways and phosphorylates various target proteins."
DNAJB6*PRAF2,"Possible functional associations between DNAJB6 and PRAF2 could be related to their involvement in protein folding and transport, as well as apoptosis regulation. DNAJB6 inhibits huntingtin aggregation and interacts with HDACs, while PRAF2 is involved in ER/Golgi transport and plays a pro-apoptotic role. The shortest path in the BioGRID interaction network suggests they may directly interact through proteins HSPA8, FAM96A, MAPK6, ESR2, and M."
SH3BP5*TP53BP1,"Possible functional association: Both genes are involved in DNA damage response and repair.          SH3BP5 functions as a negative regulatory factor in BCR-induced apoptotic cell death and interacts with MAPKs and RAB proteins. TP53BP1 plays a key role in DNA double-strand break repair and CSR during antibody genesis, as well as in telomere dynamics. The shortest path in the BioGRID protein interaction network between SH3BP5 and TP53BP1 involves MOV10, NXF1, and TRIM67. It is unclear how these interactions may be functionally relevant."
ADRB2*CD44,"Possible functional associations between ADRB2 and CD44 include involvement in cell adhesion, migration and signaling pathways promoting calcium mobilization and actin-mediated cytoskeleton reorganization essential for cell migration and adhesion. ADRB2 is a beta-adrenergic receptor that mediates catecholamine-induced activation of adenylate cyclase while CD44 plays a role in cell adhesion and migration, and serves as a platform for signal transduction by assembling protein complexes containing receptor kinases and membrane proteases."
PSMD2*SH3BP5,"PSMD2 is a part of the proteasome regulatory particle complex while SH3BP5 functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor. There is a shortest path between these two genes in the BioGRID protein interaction network, suggesting a possible association in protein degradation and intracellular transport processes."
COPB2*SCYL3,"Possible functional association: Both COPB2 and SCYL3 are involved in intracellular transport processes, with COPB2 playing a role in Golgi budding and SCYL3 potentially regulating migration complexes. They may function together in protein trafficking pathways."
BNIP3L*HDAC2,"Possible functional associations between BNIP3L and HDAC2 include their involvement in apoptotic regulation and mitochondrial quality control, as well as their participation in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. However, based on the given information, there is no direct evidence of a specific biological pathway in which these two genes functionally interact."
DUSP4*XBP1,Possible functional associations between DUSP4 and XBP1 include regulating mitogenic signal transduction and inducing unfolded protein response target genes during endoplasmic reticulum stress. These genes may potentially interact in regulating ER homeostasis and stress response in cancer cells.
CD58*HERPUD1,"Possible functional association: CD58 is involved in T-lymphocyte interactions with target cells and antigen-presenting cells, while HERPUD1 is a component of the endoplasmic reticulum quality control system. It's possible that HERPUD1 is involved in the degradation of CD58 or is required for its proper folding. However, further research is needed to confirm this potential association."
CD44*MEF2C,"Possible functional associations between CD44 and MEF2C are unclear based on the provided context, as they interact with different proteins and are involved in different processes. CD44 is a cell-surface receptor involved in cell adhesion and migration, while MEF2C is a transcription activator that controls cardiac morphogenesis and myogenesis."
HSPA8*PGRMC1,"Possible functional associations between HSPA8 and PGRMC1 include their interaction in the protein quality control system, as well as their roles in heme homeostasis and regulation of CYP activity. HSPA8 plays a critical role in mitochondrial import, chaperone-mediated autophagy, and the ER-associated degradation pathway, while PGRMC1 is a progesterone-binding protein that maintains uterine histoarchitecture and may interact with EGFR and various CYPs."
FGFR2*PLCB3,"Possible functional associations between FGFR2 and PLCB3 include FGFR2 activating PLCG1, which in turn activates PLCB3 to produce diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, both important second messenger molecules in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis."
MRPL18*XBP1,"Possible functional associations between MRPL18 and XBP1 in TCGA-LUAD include their involvement in protein homeostasis, ER stress response, and regulation of gene expression. MRPL18 is a component of the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit and acts as a mitochondrial import factor, while XBP1 functions as a transcriptional activator during ER stress by inducing unfolded protein response target genes. There is no direct evidence for a functional association between these two genes."
CETN3*HSPA8,"Possible functional associations: CETN3 and HSPA8 interact in the protein interaction network through multiple intermediates. CETN3 is involved in mRNA export and is a component of the TREX-2 complex while HSPA8 is a molecular chaperone involved in protein quality control, mitochondrial import, and autophagy. These genes may have functional associations in the regulation of protein and mRNA transport processes."
NOLC1*SLC1A4,"There are no clear functional associations between NOLC1 and SLC1A4 in specific biological processes. NOLC1 is involved in RNA polymerase I regulation, nucleologenesis, and neural crest specification, while SLC1A4 is a sodium-dependent neutral amino-acid transporter. The shortest path in their protein interaction network goes through MYC, RNF4, HSPA1A, and TRIM67."
SOCS2*ZNF451,"There is no clear functional association between SOCS2 and ZNF451 based on the provided information.  SOCS2 appears to be a negative regulator in the growth hormone/IGF1 signaling pathway, while ZNF451 is an E3 SUMO-protein ligase involved in protein modification in response to stress such as DNA damage."
ICAM1*PTPN12,"Possible functional association: PTPN12 dephosphorylates cellular tyrosine kinases, such as ERBB2, while ICAM1 interacts with ERBB2 and is degraded by viral E3 ubiquitin ligase MIR2 during microbial infection. This suggests a potential role for ICAM1 in regulating ERBB2 signaling via PTPN12-mediated dephosphorylation."
CCNE2*SMARCA4,"CCNE2 and SMARCA4 may have a functional association in regulating transcriptional activation and repression through chromatin remodeling in the context of TCGA-LUAD. The protein interaction network suggests that CCNE2 may help recruit SMARCA4 to specific regions of DNA, potentially affecting gene expression."
CDKN1B*KDM5A,"Possible functional associations between CDKN1B and KDM5A include their interaction in the BioGRID protein network through a shortest path of multiple intermediary proteins. CDKN1B regulates cell cycle progression, while KDM5A is a histone demethylase that specifically demethylates lysine-4 of histone H3, playing a central role in the histone code."
SH3BP5*STK10,"Possible functional association: SH3BP5 and STK10 are connected in the BioGRID protein interaction network through several shortest paths, indicating potential direct interactions between these two genes.   SH3BP5 functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for RAB11A and RAB25, and plays a negative regulatory role in BTK-related cytoplasmic signaling in B-cells. STK10 is a serine/threonine-protein kinase involved in regulation of lymphocyte migration and acts as a negative regulator of MAP3K1/MEKK1. There is no immediately obvious functional association between these two genes based on their known biological roles."
EGFR*FGFR2,"Possible functional associations between EGFR and FGFR2 include their interaction in the downstream signaling pathway involved in cell proliferation and differentiation. EGFR is a receptor for HCV in hepatocytes and enhances membrane fusion of cells expressing HCV envelope glycoproteins, while FGFR2 is critical for normal embryonic patterning, lung morphogenesis, osteogenesis, and skin development. Their interaction through the BioGRID protein network SHC1, STAT5A, PTPN11, GRB2, STAT3, and downstream signaling pathways may suggest a functional association in tumorigenesis and cancer progression."
