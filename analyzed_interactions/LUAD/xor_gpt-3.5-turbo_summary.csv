interaction,summary
NMT1*PCM1,"Possible functional association between NMT1 and PCM1 is unclear based on provided context and known biology. NMT1 adds a myristoyl group to certain proteins, while PCM1 is a transcriptional repressor that binds methylated DNA. The shortest path between these genes in the BioGRID protein interaction network involves multiple intervening proteins, so a direct interaction is not known."
RAC2*TMEM2,"Possible functional associations between RAC2 and TMEM2 may be related to their roles in regulating cellular responses and interactions with other proteins. RAC2 is involved in regulating secretory processes, phagocytosis, and ROS production, while TMEM2 regulates VEGF signaling during angiogenesis and heart morphogenesis, and forms a complex with cohesin proteins for cell division. There are currently no known direct interactions between these two genes."
ANXA7*DHRS7,"There is no clear functional association between ANXA7 and DHRS7 based on available information. ANXA7 is involved in calcium/phospholipid binding, membrane fusion, and exocytosis, while DHRS7 is an oxidoreductase with a role in the reduction of carbonyl-containing compounds. Both genes have not been reported to interact in literature or in the BioGRID protein interaction network."
CTNNAL1*FGFR4,"Possible functional association: CTNNAL1 may modulate the Rho pathway by interacting with ARHGEF1 while FGFR4 is a tyrosine-protein kinase that regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and various metabolic processes. It activates several signaling cascades such as MAPK and AKT. It is also down-regulated by receptor internalization and degradation.  These two genes may have a functional association in regulating cell migration and/or other cellular processes involving Rho signaling pathway since CTNNAL1 modulates the Rho pathway and FGFR4 activates a signaling cascade that involves MAPK and/or AKT. However, this association needs to be experimentally validated."
BECN1*NPC1,"Possible functional associations: Based on the shortest path in the BioGRID protein interaction network, BECN1 and NPC1 are involved in autophagy-related pathways. BECN1 is a key component of the autophagy pathway and NPC1 is involved in endocytic trafficking of cholesterol and other lipids."
CBR3*PTPRK,"There is no known functional association between CBR3 and PTPRK. CBR3 catalyzes the reduction of carbonyl compounds to alcohols and has low oxidoreductase activity, while PTPRK is a negative regulator of EGFR signaling pathway involved in cell contact, adhesion, and growth control."
ANXA7*TP53,"Possible functional associations: Both ANXA7 and TP53 are involved in apoptosis and cell cycle regulation, and have been implicated in cancer. There is a shortest path between them in the BioGRID protein interaction network. It is possible that they interact and regulate each other's functions in these processes."
GLOD4*MRPL19,There is no clear functional association between GLOD4 and MRPL19 based on their known biology and the provided context. GLOD4 regulates PTK2/FAK1 signaling and interacts with NUDT9 while MRPL19 acts as a chemokine receptor and is a component of the mitochondrial ribosomal subunit.
BECN1*TP53BP2,"Possible functional associations between BECN1 and TP53BP2 could involve regulation of apoptosis and cell growth, as well as the promotion of pro-apoptotic activity through interactions with TP53. BECN1 is involved in promoting apoptosis and inducing mitochondrial translocation of BAX, while TP53BP2 enhances TP53's DNA binding and transactivation function on the promoters of proapoptotic genes. There is no direct evidence of functional association between these two genes, but their roles in promoting apoptosis and inhibiting cell growth suggest a potential interaction or cross-regulation."
CCNE2*CDC25B,"Possible functional associations between CCNE2 and CDC25B include their involvement in the cell cycle regulation, as CCNE2 interacts with CDK2 and CDK3 to form a kinase holoenzyme complex that controls the late G1/early S phase, and CDC25B dephosphorylates CDK1 and stimulates its kinase activity at the G2/M phases. There is a short path connecting the two proteins in the BioGRID protein interaction network, suggesting a potential direct interaction in cell cycle control."
FRS2*NFKBIB,Possible functional association: FRS2 plays a role in the activation of MAP kinases and PIK3R1 in response to activated FGFR1. NFKBIB inhibits NF-kappa-B signaling. There is no clear indication of a direct interaction between FRS2 and NFKBIB based on the provided information.
GRN*TP53BP2,"Possible functional association: Both genes are involved in regulation of apoptosis. GRN stabilizes CTSD, a protease involved in cell death, and interacts with PSAP to facilitate lysosome delivery of progranulin from the extracellular space and the biosynthetic pathway, while TP53BP2 enhances TP53's DNA binding and transactivation function on promoters of proapoptotic genes and inhibits NAE1's ability to induce apoptosis. However, there is no known direct interaction between GRN and TP53BP2 in the literature."
LYPLA1*PIGB,"Possible functional associations: LYPLA1 and PIGB might not have a direct functional association given their roles in different biological processes. LYPLA1 acts as an acyl-protein thioesterase, while PIGB is involved in glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchor biosynthesis. The shortest path between these two genes in the BioGRID protein interaction network involves multiple intermediate proteins, suggesting an indirect functional relationship."
NFKBIE*PIK3R4,"Possible functional associations between NFKBIE and PIK3R4 could be through regulation of autophagy and endocytosis, as both genes are involved in different complex forms of the PI3K complex. NFKBIE inhibits NF-kappa-B by trapping it in the cytoplasm while PIK3R4 mediates the formation of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate and regulates degradative endocytic trafficking and cytokinesis."
ATF1*KCTD2,"There are no apparent functional associations between ATF1 and KCTD2 based on their known roles and interactions in the literature. ATF1 is a transcription factor involved in cell proliferation and transformation, while KCTD2 is a component of chromatin remodeling complexes. The shortest path between them in the BioGRID protein interaction network involves intermediate proteins TFAP4 and ESR1."
CETN3*NDUFC1,"Possible functional associations between CETN3 and NDUFC1 may include involvement in mitochondrial respiration and mRNA export through nuclear pores. CETN3 is part of the TREX-2 complex involved in mRNA export, while NDUFC1 is an accessory subunit of the mitochondrial membrane respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase. Further investigation may reveal more specific biological connections."
MAP7*POLR2K,"MAP7 and POLR2K are not known to have direct functional associations. MAP7 is a microtubule-stabilizing protein that may play a role in cell polarization and differentiation, while POLR2K is a subunit of RNA polymerase which catalyzes the transcription of DNA into RNA."
GLOD4*TXNDC9,"Possible functional associations between GLOD4 and TXNDC9 may involve regulation of protein folding, as TXNDC9 negatively impacts protein folding, while GLOD4 interacts with NUDT9, which is involved in protein quality control. Additionally, GLOD4 may have a role in limiting the ability of LPXN to enhance SRF-dependent gene transcription."
PIK3R4*SLC25A46,"There is no clear functional association between PIK3R4 and SLC25A46 based on the provided information. PIK3R4 is involved in regulation of membrane trafficking pathways through the PI3K complex, while SLC25A46 regulates mitochondrial organization and lipid homeostasis."
IDE*UBE2L6,"Possible functional associations between IDE and UBE2L6 include the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of FLT3, which is facilitated by both genes. IDE is also involved in microbial infection, acting as an entry receptor for specific viruses."
