ARL4C is a small GTP-binding protein involved in intracellular vesicular transport."
PMPCB*UBL5,"Possible functional associations between PMPCB and UBL5 include their involvement in protein folding and regulation of cellular processes such as mitochondrial protein processing and telomere maintenance, respectively. These genes may also interact with other proteins to regulate kinase activity."
KIAA0753*RALGDS,"Possible functional association: KIAA0753 may play a role in centriole duplication and cilium assembly, while RALGDS functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor and plays a role in intracellular transport.      They may be functionally associated in regulating intracellular transport and/or ciliary/centrosomal processes."
AURKB*MELK,"Possible functional associations: AURKB is a serine/threonine-protein kinase that is involved in regulating mitosis and cytokinesis, while MELK is also a serine/threonine-protein kinase that plays a role in cell cycle regulation, stem cell self-renewal, and apoptosis.
