RASA1*ZMIZ1,"RASA1 and ZMIZ1 may be functionally associated through the AR signaling pathway, as ZMIZ1 is a transcriptional coactivator of AR and RASA1 directly interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated AR. Additionally, ZMIZ1 is involved in the regulation of postmitotic positioning of pyramidal neurons, while RASA1 is an inhibitory regulator of the Ras-cyclic AMP pathway."
ARID5B*PIK3CA,"Possible functional associations between ARID5B and PIK3CA in TCGA-LAML cancer type may include involvement in adipogenesis, liver development, and smooth muscle cell differentiation and proliferation. ARID5B acts as a transcription coactivator while PIK3CA is a phosphoinositide-3-kinase that plays a role in cellular signaling involved in cell growth, survival, proliferation, motility, and morphology. The shortest path between these genes in the BioGRID protein interaction network involves HDAC1, KIAA1429, and FASN."
CCNA2*KIF2C,Possible functional associations between CCNA2 and KIF2C include their involvement in chromosome segregation during mitosis and their interaction with microtubules and kinetochores. CCNA2 is a cyclin that controls the G1/S and G2/M transition phases of the cell cycle while KIF2C functions as a microtubule depolymerizing activity in mitotic cells and plays a role in chromosome congression and attachment.
NRIP1*PIK3CA,"Possible functional association: NRIP1 is a coactivator for ESR1, which interacts with PIK3CA, a key enzyme in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. This suggests that NRIP1 may contribute to the regulation of this pathway through its interaction with ESR1 and subsequently PIK3CA."
APP*ARL4C,"Possible functional associations between APP and ARL4C include their roles in intracellular vesicular transport and regulation of cholesterol secretion pathways. However, based on the limited information provided, it is difficult to make specific predictions about their interactions or shared biological processes."
LYN*PRKAG2,"Possible functional association between LYN and PRKAG2 is regulation of cellular energy metabolism and cell growth/proliferation, as LYN plays a role in response to growth factors and cytokines, while PRKAG2 is an energy sensor protein kinase that regulates energy-producing and consuming processes. There are no direct protein-protein interactions reported in the BioGRID network, but the shortest path between these genes includes proteins involved in gene expression regulation and actin cytoskeleton remodeling, potentially suggesting indirect interactions."
FDFT1*MLEC,"Possible functional associations between FDFT1 and MLEC could be related to protein N-glycosylation and sterol biosynthesis, as MLEC is involved in N-glycan recognition and FDFT1 catalyzes the condensation of two farnesyl pyrophosphates to form squalene, a precursor for sterol biosynthesis. There is no direct interaction between these two genes, but their products may have indirect effects on each other through shared metabolic pathways."
ELOVL6*TBP,"There are no obvious functional associations between ELOVL6 and TBP. ELOVL6 is involved in the elongation and synthesis of fatty acids, while TBP is a transcription factor required for RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription initiation."
ACBD3*CRKL,Possible functional association: ACBD3 plays a role in viral replication while CRKL may mediate intracellular signal transduction. There is no known direct biological pathway linking these two genes.
ELAC2*RRP8,"Possible functional associations: ELAC2 is involved in tRNA maturation and associates with mitochondrial DNA complexes, while RRP8 is an essential component in the eNoSC complex that mediates silencing of rDNA in response to intracellular energy status and acts by recruiting histone-modifying enzymes. There is no specific evidence for a direct functional association between ELAC2 and RRP8."
ACLY*TP53,"One possible functional association between ACLY and TP53 is in the regulation of cell growth and division. ACLY is involved in fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis, while TP53 acts as a tumor suppressor and negatively regulates cell division. Both genes may play a role in coordinating the metabolic and cell cycle processes necessary for proper cell growth and proliferation."
LSM6*PGRMC1,"LSM6 is involved in pre-mRNA splicing and RNA degradation, while PGRMC1 is a progesterone-binding protein and a heme chaperone. There are no known direct functional associations between these two genes based on their described functions, but the BioGRID protein interaction network shows a shortest path between them involving proteins involved in DNA replication, repair, and phosphorylation, as well as receptor tyrosine kinase EGFR and small GTPase KRAS."
CDK6*PIK3C2B,"Possible functional associations between CDK6 and PIK3C2B may involve their roles in EGF and PDGF signaling cascades, as PIK3C2B phosphorylates PtdIns and PtdIns4P with a preference for PtdIns and may be involved in these pathways. CDK6, on the other hand, promotes G1/S transition, interacts with D-type G1 cyclins, and is required for cell proliferation within certain cell types, potentially suggesting a role in cell growth and division processes that may intersect with PIK3C2B's signaling functions."
CHIC2*STK10,"Possible functional associations between CHIC2 and STK10 include regulation of cell cycle and cell migration. CHIC2 is a regulatory component of the cyclin D1-CDK4 complex that phosphorylates and inhibits the retinoblastoma protein family, while STK10 is a serine/threonine kinase involved in regulation of lymphocyte migration and acts as a negative regulator of MAP3K1/MEKK1. There is a shortest path between CHIC2 and STK10 in the BioGRID protein interaction network."
PMPCB*UBL5,"Possible functional association: PMPCB and UBL5 both interact with the molecular chaperone complex TRiC. PMPCB is the catalytic subunit of the essential mitochondrial processing protease (MPP), while UBL5 is involved in the folding of actin and tubulin.
