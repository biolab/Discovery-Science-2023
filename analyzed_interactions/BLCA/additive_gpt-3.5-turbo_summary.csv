interaction,summary
RELB*SLC35A1,"RELB is involved in various biological processes such as inflammation, immunity, differentiation, tumorigenesis and apoptosis, and is a component of the NF-kappa-B RelB-p50 and RelB-p52 complex. SLC35A1 transport CMP-sialic acid from the cytosol into the Golgi apparatus and exchanges it with AMP and UMP. There is no known direct functional association between RELB and SLC35A1, but they may play indirect roles in immune response or tumor progression through their individual biological processes."
ENOPH1*UBE2L6,"Possible functional associations between ENOPH1 and UBE2L6 may include their involvement in the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of FLT3, a receptor tyrosine kinase implicated in various cellular processes including cell growth and differentiation. ENOPH1 is involved in the catalysis of an intermediate in this pathway, while UBE2L6 catalyzes the attachment of ubiquitin to target proteins."
MRPL18*TUBB6,"Possible functional association: MRPL18 is involved in mitochondrial ribosome biogenesis, while TUBB6 encodes a protein that is a major component of microtubules. These genes may be functionally associated in terms of regulating mitochondrial transport along microtubules or in tumor metastasis. However, further investigation is needed to confirm any specific biological relationship."
HYOU1*TUBB6,"Possible functional associations between HYOU1 and TUBB6 may relate to microtubule cytoskeleton dynamics, protein folding, and chaperone activity. HYOU1 is involved in cytoprotective mechanisms triggered by oxygen deprivation and participates in a large chaperone complex. Meanwhile, TUBB6 encodes the major constituent of microtubules, which are critical for maintaining cell structure and function. The protein interaction network and shortest path between the two genes suggest they may interact and impact microtubule dynamics."
ACLY*ETFB,"Possible functional association: ACLY and ETFB could be involved in the regulation of fatty acid metabolism, as ACLY is involved in the production of acetyl-CoA, a precursor for fatty acid synthesis, and ETFB is necessary for normal mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. The protein interaction network suggests that these two genes are connected via several intermediate proteins with diverse functions, indicating a potential complex regulatory network."
COG2*YKT6,"Possible functional association between COG2 and YKT6 is the regulation of vesicle transport and fusion in the Golgi apparatus and early/recycling endosomes to the trans-Golgi network. COG2 is required for normal Golgi morphology and function, while YKT6 is a v-SNARE mediating vesicle docking and fusion to a specific acceptor cellular compartment."
PTK2B*TRAPPC3,"Possible functional association: Both PTK2B and TRAPPC3 are involved in vesicular transport. PTK2B regulates cytoskeleton rearrangement and cell spreading and has been shown to interact with TRAPPC3 in BioGRID protein interaction network, which may suggest a role in regulating vesicular transport."
CEBPD*IKBKE,"CEBPD and IKBKE are functionally associated in immune and inflammatory responses and antiviral signaling. CEBPD is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses, while IKBKE is a serine/threonine kinase that plays an essential role in regulating inflammatory responses to viral infection by activating type I IFN, NF-kappa-B, and STAT signaling. The shortest path between these two genes in the BioGRID protein interaction network involves several interacting proteins, including RELA, UBC, CDC37, MTHFD1L, and DDX58."
RNH1*UBQLN2,"Possible functional association: RNH1 and UBQLN2 may play a role in the regulation of protein degradation pathways such as ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy.   RNH1 inhibits RNASE1, RNASE2 and ANG, while UBQLN2 mediates the proteasomal targeting of misfolded or accumulated proteins for degradation. It is possible that UBQLN2 may interact with RNH1 in the proteasomal degradation pathway, where RNH1 may act as a regulator or chaperone for specific proteins targeted for degradation."
NIPSNAP1*TUBB6,"Possible functional associations: NIPSNAP1 is involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis and recycling endosome membranes, while TUBB6 is majorly involved in the formation of microtubules. There could be a functional association in the regulation of endocytic recycling of endocytosed proteins or in the formation and organization of microtubules. The protein interaction network shows potential physical interactions."
ACLY*CCDC85B,"There is no clear functional association between ACLY and CCDC85B based on their known roles in biology and the provided context, which suggests involvement in different processes such as fatty acid synthesis and viral replication. However, both genes are part of a protein interaction network and may indirectly affect each other through shared interactors or pathways."
MAN2B1*SLC35A1,"Possible functional association between MAN2B1 and SLC35A1 is their interactions with EGFR, a receptor tyrosine kinase that regulates cell division and differentiation. Both genes are involved in different aspects of glycoprotein turnover and the transport of sugar-related molecules, suggesting a possible role in regulating EGFR signaling and cellular processes that depend on glycosylation."
HDAC2*TUBB6,"Possible functional associations between HDAC2 and TUBB6 are unclear based on the information provided. HDAC2 is a histone deacetylase involved in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling, while TUBB6 is a component of microtubules. However, a shortest path in the BioGRID protein interaction network suggests potential indirect interaction via other proteins."
BAG3*NUP88,"Possible functional associations between BAG3 and NUP88 are involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport and nuclear pore complex. BAG3 acts as a co-chaperone for HSP70 and HSC70 chaperone proteins, while NUP88 is a component of the nuclear pore complex and interacts with NUP214/CAN and NUP62/NUP98."
