interaction,summary
S100A13*TSKU,"Possible functional associations between S100A13 and TSKU could be related to their interactions in the copper-dependent multiprotein complex containing FGF1 and SYT1, and their roles in regulating various signaling pathways, developmental events, and wound healing processes, as well as cholesterol homeostasis and bone elongation. However, without additional information or experimental evidence, it is difficult to determine the specific nature of their functional relationship."
LPAR2*LRPAP1,"Possible functional association between LPAR2 and LRPAP1: LRPAP1 is a molecular chaperone for LDL receptor-related proteins and interacts with LRP1, which is known to form a complex with LPAR2. Thus, LRPAP1 may play a role in regulating LPAR2 signaling and activity."
CIAPIN1*MAP2K5,"There is no clear functional association between CIAPIN1 and MAP2K5 based on the given context and their known biology. CIAPIN1 is involved in cytosolic Fe-S biogenesis and has anti-apoptotic effects, while MAP2K5 acts as a scaffold for MAPK signaling and is involved in cellular stress response and development. The BioGRID interaction network shows a short path between these genes through the HSPA8 protein, but the biological significance of this interaction is unclear."
ELAVL1*PAN2,"There is no obvious functional association between ELAVL1 and PAN2 based on their known biological roles. ELAVL1 is an RNA-binding protein involved in stabilizing target mRNA, while PAN2 is a retinol dehydrogenase with no known connection to RNA metabolism."
CD44*NET1,"Possible functional association: CD44 and NET1 are both involved in cell adhesion and migration. CD44 is a cell-surface receptor that plays a role in sensing and responding to changes in the tissue microenvironment, while NET1 lacks transporter activity and forms active transcriptional complexes with other proteins. It is possible that they interact to regulate these processes."
CNPY3*TFAP2A,"There is no clear functional association between CNPY3 and TFAP2A, as they have distinct roles in the immune response and transcriptional regulation respectively. CNPY3 is involved in Toll-like receptor folding and controls TLR exit from the endoplasmic reticulum, while TFAP2A regulates gene expression in development and morphology. The shortest path between these two genes in the BioGRID network involves the EGFR protein, implying a possible indirect interaction through signaling pathways."
CD44*TCTA,"Possible functional association between CD44 and TCTA could be in cell adhesion and migration processes. CD44 is a cell-surface receptor that plays a role in cell-cell interactions and migration, while TCTA may be required for cellular fusion and interacts with ribosomes. There could be a biological connection between these two genes in coordinating cellular processes related to adhesion, migration, and fusion."
PLA2G15*SPAG7,"Possible functional association: PLA2G15 is involved in phospholipid homeostasis and participates in the canonical and alternative replication protein A complex, while SPAG7 is associated with ribosomal assembly and DNA binding via dimerization with bHLH proteins. These genes may potentially interact in DNA and/or RNA metabolism processes."
AP1B1*ELAVL1,"Possible functional associations between AP1B1 and ELAVL1 in TCGA-PRAD include protein sorting and mRNA stability and regulation, respectively. While these genes may not directly interact, their involvement in cellular processes such as endosomal protein sorting and embryonic stem cell differentiation suggest potential functional relationships in cell signaling and gene regulation."
CAB39*PTPN6,"Both CAB39 and PTPN6 have roles in regulating signaling pathways, with CAB39 being involved in STK11/LKB1 activation and PTPN6 modulating tyrosine phosphorylation of cell surface receptors. Their interaction through EGFR may suggest a potential involvement in the regulation of growth factor signaling pathways in prostate cancer cells."
CSNK2A2*TBC1D15,"Possible functional association: CSNK2A2 is a protein kinase that regulates numerous cellular processes, including transcription and apoptosis, while TBC1D15 acts as a GTPase activating protein for RAB7A. These genes may be involved in regulating cellular signaling pathways and intracellular vesicle trafficking. The shortest path between them in the BioGRID protein interaction network includes proteins involved in transcription and ubiquitination processes."
HMGCS1*SIRT3,"Possible functional association: HMGCS1 and SIRT3 may be involved in regulating cellular energy metabolism through the deacetylation of key lysine residues in mitochondrial target proteins and regulating tissue-specific ATP levels.  HMGCS1 catalyzes the condensation of acetyl-CoA with acetoacetyl-CoA to form HMG-CoA, which is a precursor for cholesterol synthesis, while SIRT3 is a NAD-dependent protein deacetylase that promotes mtDNA transcription, regulates ceramide metabolism, and interacts with several mitochondrial proteins. The shortest path between these two genes in the BioGRID protein interaction network involves CS and TRIM67, suggesting potential direct or indirect functional links through these proteins."
EPN2*NRAS,"There is no clear indication of any direct functional association between EPN2 and NRAS. EPN2 is involved in endocytosis while NRAS is a GTPase that interacts with RGS14 and RASSF7. Their roles appear to be unrelated, but further investigation is needed to fully understand their potential interactions in cancer."
CNPY3*TSKU,"Possible functional associations: CNPY3 is involved in immune response and interacts with Toll-like receptors, while TSKU contributes to various developmental events and inhibits Wnt signaling. These genes may have a role in immune response during development and tissue differentiation. The shortest path between CNPY3 and TSKU in the BioGRID protein interaction network involves the protein ORF3a, which could also play a role in this process."
ALDOA*CD44,"ALDOA and CD44 potentially functionally associate in tumor growth and metastasis, as CD44 plays a role in cell-cell interactions, adhesion, migration, and response to bacterial infection while ALDOA catalyzes the reversible conversion of beta-D-fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) into two triose phosphate and plays a key role in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. The shortest path between these two genes in the BioGRID protein interaction network involves EGFR, MYC, AKT1, LGALS1, and FN1."
IGF1R*PLA2G15,"Possible functional associations between IGF1R and PLA2G15 may be related to their roles in cellular growth and apoptosis regulation. IGF1R, when activated, can accelerate cell division and reduce apoptosis, while PLA2G15 is involved in phospholipid catabolism and has been reported to be active in apoptosis. Additionally, the shortest path between the two genes in the BioGRID protein interaction network suggests that they may be functionally connected through several other proteins involved in cellular processes like protein degradation and immune system response."
AP1B1*CIAPIN1,"Based on their roles in protein sorting and cytosolic iron-sulfur protein assembly, it is unlikely that AP1B1 and CIAPIN1 have direct functional associations. AP1B1 is involved in protein sorting in the Golgi/trans-Golgi network and endosomes, while CIAPIN1 is required for the maturation of extramitochondrial iron-sulfur proteins and has anti-apoptotic effects."
