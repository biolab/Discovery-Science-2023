PRKACA is a catalytic subunit of protein kinase A, involved in regulation of diverse cellular processes such as metabolism and cell division. SRP14 is a component of the signal recognition particle complex, playing a role in the cotranslational targeting of secretory and membrane proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum."
CYCS*WDR7,"There is no clear functional association between CYCS and WDR7 based on the provided context and their known biological roles. CYCS is involved in apoptosis and mitochondrial membrane permeability, while WDR7 is a ribosome biogenesis factor involved in pre-18S ribosomal RNA processing and SSU processome assembly."
NOP16*PAN2,"There is currently no known functional association between NOP16 and PAN2 in specific biological terms. NOP16 is involved in the succinyl-CoA synthetase function in the citric acid cycle, while PAN2 has retinol dehydrogenase activity with a preference for NADP."
RFC2*ZNF318,Possible functional association: RFC2 and ZNF318 may be involved in transcriptional regulation and DNA replication processes.   RFC2 is a subunit of the RFC complex that is involved in DNA replication and interacts with PCNA and PRKAR1A. ZNF318 acts as a transcriptional coactivator for AR-mediated transactivation function and may be involved in meiotic division during spermatogenesis. The shortest path between RFC2 and ZNF318 in the BioGRID protein interaction network suggests possible functional associations in regulating gene expression.
CHMP4A*MAPK1IP1L,"There is no known functional association between CHMP4A and MAPK1IP1L in specific biological terms based on the provided context and knowledge about biology. CHMP4A is involved in multivesicular body formation and sorting of endosomal cargo proteins, while MAPK1IP1L has been implicated in regulating transcriptional activity and interacts with ZNF202."
ARNT2*SDHB,"Possible functional association between ARNT2 and SDHB in TCGA-PRAD may involve mitochondrial function. ARNT2 is a transcription factor involved in postnatal brain growth and renal function, while SDHB is an iron-sulfur protein subunit of the succinate dehydrogenase complex responsible for transferring electrons in mitochondrial respiration."
SYF2*TBC1D15,"There are no known direct functional associations between SYF2 and TBC1D15. SYF2 is involved in pre-mRNA splicing as a component of the spliceosome, while TBC1D15 acts as a GTPase activating protein for RAB7A. These genes may participate in distinct biological processes."
AP1B1*TSTA3,"Possible functional associations:  AP1B1 is a subunit of the adaptor protein complex 1 that plays a role in protein sorting in the late-Golgi/trans-Golgi network and/or endosomes. TSTA3 catalyzes the conversion of GDP-4-dehydro-6-deoxy-D-mannose to GDP-fucose. There is no known direct biological process that associates these two genes, as both of them are involved in distinct biological processes."
PIK3C2B*RFC2,"Possible functional associations between PIK3C2B and RFC2 may involve their roles in cell signaling and DNA replication, respectively. PIK3C2B phosphorylates phoshatidylinositols (PI and PIP), and may be involved in EGF and PDGF signaling cascades. RFC2 is involved in DNA replication elongation, and interacts with PCNA and DDX11."
APOE*EPN2,"Possible functional associations between APOE and EPN2 include their interaction in clathrin-coated invaginations and endocytosis. Additionally, APOE may participate in microbial infection, including interaction with hepatitis C virus envelope glycoprotein E2."
ECH1*ZFP36,"There are no clear functional associations between ECH1 and ZFP36, as they are involved in different biological processes. ECH1 is responsible for the isomerization of dienoyl-CoA, while ZFP36 negatively regulates HTLV-1 TAX-dependent transactivation of viral LTR promoter through its interaction with HTLV-1 TAX."
GNAI1*RFC2,"Possible functional association between GNAI1 and RFC2 is their involvement in cell cycle regulation and DNA replication. GNAI1 plays a role in cytokinesis during mitosis and is required for cortical dynein-dynactin complex recruitment during metaphase, while RFC2 is needed for the elongation of primed DNA templates by DNA polymerase delta and epsilon. The shortest path between these genes in the BioGRID protein interaction network includes genes that are related to mitosis, cytokinesis, and DNA replication, supporting their possible functional association."
MSRA*NCAPD2,"Possible functional association: NCAPD2 is a component of the condensin complex, which is involved in mitotic chromosome condensation, while MSRA has a repair function for proteins that have been inactivated by oxidation. It is possible that NCAPD2 and MSRA cooperate in maintaining chromosome integrity during cell division by protecting chromosome-associated proteins from oxidative damage."
CSRP1*HPRT1,"There is no known direct functional association between CSRP1 and HPRT1. CSRP1 plays a role in neuronal development and interacts with ASCC1, ASCC2, and TRIP4. HPRT1 is involved in the purine salvage pathway and converts guanine and hypoxanthine into nucleotides."
RFC2*WDR7,"Possible functional associations between RFC2 and WDR7 are in ribosome biogenesis and nucleolar processing of pre-18S ribosomal RNA. RFC2 is an accessory protein for DNA polymerase, while WDR7 is involved in pre-ribosomal RNA transcription and small subunit (SSU) processome assembly."
ADH5*WDR7,"There are no known direct functional associations between ADH5 and WDR7, as they are involved in different biological processes. ADH5 catalyzes the oxidation of alcohols and fatty acids, while WDR7 is involved in ribosome biogenesis and pre-rRNA transcription."
SLC25A22*WDR7,"Possible functional associations between SLC25A22 and WDR7 could be in the regulation of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and ribosome biogenesis, respectively. There is no direct evidence of a biological process connecting these two genes."
RFC2*ZNF451,"ZNF451 is a protein that acts as an E3 SUMO-protein ligase. RFC2 is part of a heterotetramer that acts as an accessory protein in the elongation of primed DNA templates by DNA polymerase delta and epsilon. Based on the provided context, it is possible that ZNF451 is involved in the sumoylation of RFC2 or its interacting partners, potentially affecting DNA replication or repair."
ELAVL1*WDR7,"ELAVL1 and WDR7 do not appear to have any direct functional associations based on their known roles. ELAVL1 is an RNA-binding protein involved in stabilizing mRNA, while WDR7 is a ribosome biogenesis factor involved in processing pre-18S ribosomal RNA."
APOE*TRIB1,There are no clear functional associations between APOE and TRIB1 in specific biological terms based on the limited information provided. APOE is involved in cellular attachment and infectivity of hepatitis C virus while TRIB1 is an adapter protein involved in protein degradation and regulation of myeloid cell differentiation.
