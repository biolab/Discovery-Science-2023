interaction,summary
AP1B1*EPN2,Possible functional associations between AP1B1 and EPN2 could involve endocytosis and protein sorting in the Golgi/trans-Golgi network and/or endosomes. Both genes are part of protein complexes involved in the recruitment of clathrin to membranes and the recognition of sorting signals. The shortest path between AP1B1 and EPN2 in the BioGRID protein interaction network involves multiple clathrin-associated proteins.
CCDC86*PMM2,Possible functional association between CCDC86 and PMM2 is not clear based on the provided context and their known functions. CCDC86 has antibacterial activity and interacts with hepatitis C virus protein NS5A while PMM2 is involved in the synthesis of GDP-mannose and dolichol-phosphate-mannose required for mannosyl transfer reactions. Both genes do not seem to share any direct biological processes.
SLC25A46*TFAP2A,"There is no obvious functional association between SLC25A46 and TFAP2A based on their known roles in regulating mitochondrial organization and transcriptional activation, respectively. However, the shortest path between them in the BioGRID protein interaction network suggests a potential indirect interaction through NUP35, a nucleoporin that plays a role in nuclear transport."
P4HTM*TSKU,"There is no clear functional association between P4HTM and TSKU. P4HTM catalyzes the hydroxylation of HIF alpha proteins, while TSKU regulates various developmental processes and inhibits Wnt signaling."
BAG6*PRAF2,"There are no known direct functional associations between BAG6 and PRAF2. BAG6 is involved in mediating ricin-induced apoptosis and interacts with L. pneumophila Lpg2160 and LegU1 proteins. PRAF2 may be involved in ER/Golgi transport, vesicular traffic, and plays a proapoptotic role in cerulenin-induced neuroblastoma apoptosis and interacts with CCR5 and GDE1."
MACF1*ZNF451,"Possible functional associations between MACF1 and ZNF451 are unknown. MACF1 plays a role in cross-linking actin to other cytoskeletal proteins, stabilizing microtubules, and regulating focal adhesions assembly and dynamics. ZNF451 acts as an E3 SUMO-protein ligase, facilitating UBE2I/UBC9-mediated sumoylation of target proteins and negatively regulates transcriptional activation mediated by the SMAD4 complex in response to TGF-beta signaling."
CYCS*TIMM9,"Possible functional associations between CYCS and TIMM9 include their roles in mitochondrial function and regulation. CYCS plays a key role in apoptosis by releasing from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm and activating caspases, while TIMM9 is involved in the import and insertion of transmembrane proteins into the inner mitochondrial membrane. These genes may interact in the mitochondria to regulate protein import and cycling, as well as in apoptotic pathways."
CYCS*TXNDC9,"Possible functional associations between CYCS and TXNDC9 include involvement in apoptosis regulation and protein folding, as indicated by their respective roles in mitochondrial membrane permeability and chaperonin TCP1 complex ATPase activity. The shortest path in the BioGRID protein interaction network between the two genes involves four intermediate proteins, including PRDX2 and BAG1."
CPSF4*ELAVL1,"There are no clear functional associations between CPSF4 and ELAVL1, as they function in different biological processes. CPSF4 is a component of the pre-mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation complex, while ELAVL1 is an RNA-binding protein involved in mRNA stability and embryonic stem cell differentiation. The interaction between these two genes may occur through indirect pathways in the protein interaction network."
CYCS*SLC25A22,Possible functional association between CYCS and SLC25A22 is their involvement in mitochondrial function. CYCS is involved in regulating apoptosis by releasing cytochrome c from mitochondria while SLC25A22 is responsible for the transport of glutamate across the mitochondrial membrane. They both have a role in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis.
MRPL12*SLC25A22,"Possible functional association between MRPL12 and SLC25A22: Both genes are involved in mitochondrial functions, with MRPL12 being a component of the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit and SLC25A22 being a mitochondrial glutamate/H(+) symporter. They are connected through the BioGRID interaction network by several proteins, suggesting they may be functionally related in mitochondrial processes."
CCDC92*EPN2,"Possible functional associations: None could be inferred based on the context and knowledge of biology of these two genes.          CCDC92 is an interferon-stimulated protein involved in innate immunity that inhibits ebolavirus transcription and replication. EPN2 plays a role in endocytosis by binding to clathrin and AP-2 and interacts with UBQLN2, a protein involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system."
PAN2*SPECC1L,"Possible functional association: PAN2 may interact with SPECC1L in microtubule stabilization, which is required for proper cell adhesion and migration. Additionally, PAN2 interacts with human cytomegalovirus immediate early protein IE1, which leads to STAT3 nuclear accumulation and disruption of IL6-induced STAT3 phosphorylation."
PTPRF*TSKU,"There is no clear indication of functional association between PTPRF and TSKU, as they only share two indirect protein interactions in the BioGRID network. PTPRF is involved in substrate specificity and interacts with GRIP1 and PPFIA proteins, while TSKU plays roles in Wnt signaling inhibition, hair cycle regulation, bone elongation, cholesterol homeostasis, and wound healing, and interacts with multiple signaling pathways."
ASH2L*ZNF451,"Based on the BioGRID protein interaction network, ASH2L and ZNF451 may be functionally associated. ASH2L is involved in histone methylation and dimethylation, while ZNF451 is an E3 SUMO-protein ligase that facilitates sumoylation of target proteins. They could potentially interact to regulate gene expression through post-translational modifications of histones and proteins."
NDUFA3*SPAG7,"Possible functional associations between NDUFA3 and SPAG7 include regulating the localization of the 5S ribonucleoprotein particle to the nucleolus and being involved in mitochondrial respiratory chain function. However, there is no direct biological connection between these two genes based on their known functions."
CNPY3*PTPN6,"There are no obvious functional associations between CNPY3 and PTPN6 based on their known biology and protein interaction network. CNPY3 is involved in innate and adaptive immune responses by regulating Toll-like receptor folding, while PTPN6 modulates signaling by tyrosine phosphorylated cell surface receptors and plays a key role in hematopoiesis."
CCNH*CYCS,"CCNH regulates CDK7, a kinase that activates cyclin-associated kinases and RNA polymerase II. CYCS plays a role in apoptosis and binds to Apaf-1 to trigger caspase-9 activation. Both genes are linked via the BioGRID protein interaction network, where CCNH interacts with MYC, CDK2, DDX58, EGFR, and KRAS to connect with CYCS. It is possible that CCNH plays a role in regulating apoptosis via CYCS, but further research is needed to confirm any functional associations."
PGRMC1*PRAF2,Possible functional associations: No clear functional associations between PGRMC1 and PRAF2 have been reported in the literature.   PGRMC1: a progesterone-binding protein that has several cellular functions including heme homeostasis and interaction with CYPs. It is required for the maintenance of uterine histoarchitecture in females.   PRAF2: possibly involved in ER/Golgi transport and vesicular traffic. It plays a proapoptotic role in cerulenin-induced neuroblastoma apoptosis and interacts with CCR5 and GDE1.
MACF1*ZMIZ1,"MACF1 is involved in regulating actin and microtubule arrangement and stabilization, neurite outgrowth, and Wnt signaling. ZMIZ1 is a transcriptional coactivator involved in the TGF-beta signaling pathway, thymocyte and T cell development, and NOTCH1 target gene activation. Possible functional associations could include regulation of transcriptional activity or signaling pathways through protein-protein interactions or co-regulation."
