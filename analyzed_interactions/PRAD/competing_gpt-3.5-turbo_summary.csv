interaction,summary
PAN2*SPECC1L,"There is no known direct functional association between PAN2 and SPECC1L. PAN2 is involved in mRNA deadenylation and regulation of HIF1A-mediated hypoxic response, while SPECC1L is involved in cytokinesis, spindle organization, and actin cytoskeleton organization."
CCDC86*PMM2,"Based on their presence in the same interaction network, CCDC86 and PMM2 may have a functional association in protein-protein interactions. CCDC86 is involved in antibacterial activity and contributes to the bactericidal activity of amniotic fluid, while PMM2 is involved in the synthesis of important mannosyl transfer reactions."
CCDC92*EPN2,"Possible functional associations between CCDC92 and EPN2 could be related to endocytosis and innate immunity, as CCDC92 is involved in immune response and EPN2 plays a role in endocytosis. The shortest path in the BioGRID network also suggests a direct physical interaction between the two proteins via UBC and/or nsp2."
PTPRF*TSKU,"Possible functional associations between PTPRF and TSKU could be their involvement in Wnt signaling and development events, as both genes have been shown to interact with this pathway and play essential roles in various developmental processes such as the formation of the peripheral eye and the anterior commissure in the brain. Additionally, TSKU has been implicated in regulating cholesterol homeostasis and wound healing through multiple signaling pathways, potentially indicating a broader regulatory role for these two genes in biological processes."
PGRMC1*PRAF2,"There is no obvious functional association between PGRMC1 and PRAF2 based on their known biological roles. PGRMC1 is involved in progesterone binding, heme homeostasis, and acts as an intracellular heme chaperone, while PRAF2 has potential roles in ER/Golgi transport and vesicular traffic, as well as proapoptotic effects in neuroblastoma."
CYCS*TIMM9,"Possible functional associations between CYCS and TIMM9 include their involvement in mitochondrial activities such as apoptosis, import and insertion of multi-pass transmembrane proteins into the mitochondrial inner membrane, and transfer of beta-barrel precursors. CYCS is involved in apoptosis through the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, while TIMM9 acts as a mitochondrial intermembrane chaperone during protein import and insertion."
BAG6*PRAF2,Possible functional association: Both genes are involved in apoptosis and protein transport. BAG6 mediates ricin-induced apoptosis while PRAF2 plays a proapoptotic role in cerulenin-induced apoptosis. PRAF2 may also be involved in ER/Golgi transport and vesicular traffic. There is a shortest path of protein interactions between the two genes in the BioGRID network. There may be a functional association between the two genes in protein transport and apoptosis.
MRPL12*SLC25A22,"Possible functional associations between MRPL12 and SLC25A22 could be related to mitochondrial function and metabolism. MRPL12 is a component of the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit, playing a role in mitochondrial translation, while SLC25A22 is a mitochondrial glutamate/H(+) symporter responsible for the transport of glutamate from cytosol into the mitochondrial matrix. Their interaction may be related to the regulation of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, mitochondrial metabolism, and possibly mitochondrial disorders."
CYCS*SLC25A22,"Possible functional associations: CYCS plays a role in apoptosis by triggering caspase activation, while SLC25A22 is involved in mitochondrial glutamate transport. These genes do not have a direct functional association, but both are involved in mitochondrial processes and can contribute to the regulation of cell death and energy metabolism."
MACF1*ZNF451,"Possible functional associations between MACF1 and ZNF451 are unclear based on the provided context. However, MACF1 has contrasting roles in cell death and survival, including being involved in tumor suppression and resistance against chemotherapeutic drugs. ZNF451 is a E3 SUMO-protein ligase that facilitates sumoylation of target proteins and negatively regulates transcriptional activation mediated by the SMAD4 complex in response to TGF-beta signaling."
ASH2L*ZNF451,"Possible functional associations between ASH2L and ZNF451 include their interaction in the regulation of transcriptional activation and histone modification. ASH2L is involved in the methylation of histone H3, while ZNF451 is an E3 SUMO-protein ligase that facilitates sumoylation of target proteins. It is possible that these two genes may participate in cooperative regulation of chromatin dynamics and gene expression."
NDUFA3*SPAG7,"There are no clear functional associations between NDUFA3 and SPAG7 based on their known roles in mitochondrial respiratory chain and ribosomal assembly, respectively. However, the shortest pathway between them in the protein interaction network suggests a potential indirect interaction through LMNB1, which may play a role in nuclear architecture and gene expression regulation."
CCNH*CYCS,"Possible functional association between CCNH and CYCS is regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis. CCNH is involved in cell cycle control and RNA transcription, while CYCS plays a role in triggering apoptosis by releasing cytochrome c from mitochondria. The shortest path between them in the BioGRID protein interaction network suggests that they may be part of a protein complex involved in these processes."
SLC25A46*TFAP2A,"Possible functional associations: There are currently no known functional associations between SLC25A46 and TFAP2A.          Gene functions: SLC25A46 is a transmembrane protein that regulates mitochondrial organization and lipid homeostasis. TFAP2A is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein that regulates transcription of genes involved in early developmental processes such as eye, face, and neural tube development."
P4HTM*TSKU,"Possible functional associations between P4HTM and TSKU may involve their role in the regulation of TGF-beta signaling, since TSKU has been shown to interact with TGFB1 and P4HTM can hydroxylate HIF1A, a downstream target of TGF-beta. Additionally, P4HTM may play a role in wound healing through its inhibition of hypoxia-induced macrophage infiltration and subsequent myofibroblast differentiation, a process which TSKU has also been shown to modulate."
CPSF4*ELAVL1,"Based on the provided context and their protein interaction network, CPSF4 and ELAVL1 may function together in pre-mRNA 3'-end formation and mRNA stability, respectively. It is possible that they contribute to the regulation of gene expression."
AP1B1*EPN2,"Possible functional associations between AP1B1 and EPN2 include their involvement in protein sorting in the Golgi/trans-Golgi network and endocytosis, respectively. The shortest path in the BioGRID protein interaction network between these genes suggests that they may interact and play a role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis."
MACF1*ZMIZ1,"Possible functional associations between MACF1 and ZMIZ1 include transcriptional activation and regulation of cell death. MACF1 is involved in both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic pathways, while ZMIZ1 acts as a transcriptional coactivator in different signaling pathways such as AR and TGF-beta. Though no direct interaction between MACF1 and ZMIZ1 has been reported, there is a shortest path between these two proteins in the BioGRID protein interaction network, which could suggest potential indirect functional associations."
CNPY3*PTPN6,"One possible functional association between CNPY3 and PTPN6 could be their involvement in immune responses. CNPY3 is a co-chaperone for Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and controls their folding, while PTPN6 modulates signaling by tyrosine phosphorylated cell surface receptors and plays a key role in hematopoiesis. TLRs are important in recognizing pathogens and activating the immune response, and PTPN6 is known to be involved in regulation of immune cell activity. The interaction between CNPY3 and PTPN6 may be important in regulating TLR signaling and immune responses."
CYCS*TXNDC9,"Possible functional association: CYCS and TXNDC9 are involved in the regulation of apoptosis and protein folding, respectively, which suggests a potential connection between mitochondrial function and protein quality control. The interaction between these two proteins in the BioGRID network may facilitate communication between these processes."
