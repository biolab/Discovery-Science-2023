interaction,summary
CHIC2*LOXL1,"CHIC2 and LOXL1 are not known to have any direct functional associations in biological processes. CHIC2 is a regulatory component of the cyclin D1-CDK4 complex involved in the cell cycle, while LOXL1 is involved in modifying elastin and collagen substrates. The shortest path between these genes in the BioGRID protein interaction network involves several intermediate interactions through other proteins."
AKAP8L*FIS1,"Possible functional associations between AKAP8L and FIS1 include involvement in mitochondrial fission and regulation of viral genomic RNA annealing during HIV-1 infection. AKAP8L interacts with DHX9 and HIV-1 reverse transcriptase/ribonuclease H, while FIS1 plays a role in mitochondrial fragmentation and recruitment of dynamin-related protein 1 (DNM1L)."
BRPF1*FIS1,"Possible functional association: BRPF1 is a subunit of various histone acetyltransferase complexes and positively regulates transcription, while FIS1 is involved in mitochondrial fission and cytochrome c release leading to apoptosis. It is unclear if there is a direct functional association between these two genes in specific biological terms."
ADNP2*FIS1,"Possible functional association: FIS1 is involved in mitochondrial fragmentation and ADNP2 might play a role in the protection of brain tissues from oxidative stress and transcriptional regulation. Therefore, it is possible that ADNP2 may regulate FIS1 expression in neuronal cells under oxidative stress conditions."
PUM2*TIMM9,"There is no clear functional association between PUM2 and TIMM9 based on their known roles. PUM2 is a post-transcriptional repressor of mRNA targets, while TIMM9 is a mitochondrial intermembrane chaperone involved in protein import. The shortest path between them in the BioGRID protein interaction network involves the protein ZRANB1."
MBNL1*SPTAN1,Possible functional association between MBNL1 and SPTAN1 is that MBNL1 mediates alternative pre-mRNA splicing while SPTAN1 is involved in cytoskeleton movement. MBNL1's interaction with SPTAN1 through DHX9 and HNRNPK may affect cytoskeleton dynamics by modifying pre-mRNA splicing patterns.
ABHD6*FIS1,"ABHD6 is involved in lipid metabolism and endocannabinoid signaling pathways, while FIS1 plays a role in mitochondrial fission and peroxisomal fission. There might be a possible association between ABHD6 and FIS1 in lipid sorting and mitochondrial homeostasis."
DNAJB1*FIS1,"Possible functional associations between DNAJB1 and FIS1 could be in the process of mitochondrial fission and fragmentation, as they both play roles in this process. DNAJB1 negatively regulates heat shock-induced transcriptional activity, while FIS1 is involved in peroxisomal fission and can induce apoptosis through cytochrome c release from mitochondria."
MYCBP2*SKP1,"Possible functional association between MYCBP2 and SKP1: MYCBP2 may function as an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase for SKP1 through its interaction with E2 enzymes. SKP1 is an essential component of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex, which mediates the ubiquitination of proteins involved in cell cycle progression, signal transduction, and transcription."
ATP6V0B*PUM2,"There are no known direct functional associations between ATP6V0B and PUM2. ATP6V0B encodes for a subunit of the V-ATPase enzyme involved in pH regulation and membrane acidification, while PUM2 encodes for a RNA-binding protein involved in post-transcriptional repression. However, based on the BioGRID protein interaction network, the two genes may indirectly interact through the protein MOV10."
MACF1*NOLC1,"Based on the provided context, MACF1 and NOLC1 could be functionally associated with ribosomal processing and modification. MACF1 may play a role in tumor suppression and survival while NOLC1 acts as a regulator of RNA polymerase I, connecting it with enzymes responsible for ribosomal processing and modification. The shortest path in the BioGRID protein interaction network between MACF1 and NOLC1 suggests possible protein interactions that could contribute to their functional association in this process."
CDC25B*PUM2,"Based on the protein interaction network and gene functions, CDC25B and PUM2 are not known to have direct functional associations. CDC25B is involved in cell cycle progression and dephosphorylation of CDK1, while PUM2 is a RNA-binding protein that regulates mRNA stability and translation."
BAX*FIS1,BAX and FIS1 have been found to interact in the BioGRID protein interaction network. BAX plays a role in mitochondrial apoptotic process while FIS1 is involved in the fragmentation of the mitochondrial network and its perinuclear clustering. This suggests that these genes may have a functional association in the process of mitochondrial fission and apoptosis.
RBM6*SUCLG1,"There are no direct known functional associations between RBM6 and SUCLG1, however, based on their respective functions in RNA binding and the citric acid cycle, it is possible that dysregulation of RBM6 could affect the function of SUCLG1. RBM6 specifically binds poly(G) RNA homopolymers while SUCLG1 plays a key role in the citric acid cycle."
FIS1*JUN,"FIS1 and JUN are not known to have a direct functional association according to the given context. FIS1 plays a role in mitochondrial fission and may induce apoptosis, while JUN is a transcription factor involved in binding to DNA and enhancing transcriptional activity."
MACF1*PAICS,"There is no clear evidence of a functional association between MACF1 and PAICS. MACF1 is involved in DNA damage-induced apoptosis and tumor suppression, while PAICS plays a role in de novo purine biosynthetic pathway."
NUP93*PUM2,"Possible functional associations between NUP93 and PUM2 could be related to regulation of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level, as PUM2 is known to play a role in mRNA degradation and regulation of miRNAs, and NUP93 is involved in nuclear pore complex assembly and maintenance, which regulates the transport of mRNA between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Additionally, the shortest path in the BioGRID protein interaction network between these two genes includes MYC and BMI1, which are both known to be involved in regulation of gene expression and cancer development."
FIS1*MRPS16,"There is no clear functional association between FIS1 and MRPS16 based on the provided context. FIS1 is involved in mitochondrial and peroxisomal fission and can induce apoptosis, while MRPS16 is a component of the mitochondrial subunit and is also involved in cell survival, proliferation, and hematopoiesis."
CCNA2*PUM2,"There is no obvious functional association between CCNA2 and PUM2 based on their known roles. CCNA2 is involved in cell cycle control, while PUM2 plays a role in post-transcriptional gene regulation. However, they do interact through the BioGRID protein interaction network, potentially indicating a cellular mechanism linking them."
