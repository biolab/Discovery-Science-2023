FIS1*UBE2J1,"Possible functional associations between FIS1 and UBE2J1 include their involvement in protein degradation pathways as part of the HRD1 complex, and FIS1's role in mitochondrial fission and apoptosis. However, there is no known direct interaction or functional association between these two genes based on the provided context."
KAT6A*RBM6,"Possible functional association: Both KAT6A and RBM6 have been shown to interact with transcriptional regulators, such as RUNX1 and p53/TP53, suggesting a potential role in regulating gene expression.   KAT6A: a histone acetyltransferase that acetylates lysine residues in histones, and acts as a coactivator for transcription factors. It also interacts with PML, a protein involved in regulating cellular responses to DNA damage.   RBM6: specifically binds poly(G) RNA homopolymers in vitro, with potential roles in RNA processing and regulation. It may also interact with FAM168B, a protein involved in DNA repair.   Overall, there is currently no direct evidence of functional association between KAT6A and RBM6, but both genes appear to play roles in transcriptional regulation and could potentially intersect in this context."

The shortest path between PPARG and TRIB1 in the BioGRID protein interaction network is PPARG-CEBPB-TRIB1."
ERBB2*PUM2,"Possible functional associations between ERBB2 and PUM2 include regulation of transcriptional activation and post-transcriptional repression. ERBB2 is involved in transcriptional regulation by activating PTGS2/COX-2 promoter and enhancing protein synthesis and cell growth, while PUM2 acts as a post-transcriptional repressor by binding to the 3'-UTR of mRNA targets, leading to translational inhibition and mRNA degradation. The BioGRID protein interaction network shows a shortest path between ERBB2 and PUM2 via intermediate proteins, suggesting potential functional associations between them through protein-protein interactions."
FIS1*HSD17B11,"There are no known direct functional associations between FIS1 and HSD17B11. FIS1 plays a role in mitochondrial fission and peroxisomal fission, and is involved in apoptosis. HSD17B11 may participate in androgen metabolism during steroidogenesis and acts as a tumor-associated antigen in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma."
LOXL1*NOLC1,"Possible functional associations: LOXL1 is involved in substrate modification while NOLC1 is a nucleolar protein that regulates RNA polymerase I and plays a role in neural crest specification. It is possible that LOXL1 could modify substrates important for neural crest specification, thus potentially affecting the function of NOLC1. However, further investigation is needed to determine if there is a direct functional association between these two genes."
PAN2*RBM6,"Possible functional associations between PAN2 and RBM6 include mRNA processing and regulation. PAN2 is involved in mRNA deadenylation and decay, while RBM6 is a poly(G) RNA binding protein. The BioGRID protein interaction network suggests they may interact through EEF1G, PPP1CB, XRN2, ELAVL1, and PLEC."
BHLHE40*TPM1,"Possible functional associations between BHLHE40 and TPM1 include BHLHE40's regulation of chondrocyte differentiation via cAMP pathway and transcriptional repression of ATP1B1 in cardiovascular system, which may affect TPM1's involvement in stabilizing cytoskeleton actin filaments. TPM1 also plays a central role, in association with the troponin complex, in calcium dependent regulation of muscle contraction."
LOXL1*MACF1,"Possible functional associations between LOXL1 and MACF1 involve their role in cell migration, specifically in regulating focal adhesion size and dynamics. LOXL1 interacts with EFEMP2 and MACF1 interacts with CAMSAP3, both of which play a role in coordinating microtubule dynamics and regulating actin filaments. Additionally, MACF1 is involved in stabilizing microtubules, which is essential for efficient upward migration of bulge cells in response to wound healing, a process that requires coordination with focal adhesions. Overall, these genes may work together to regulate the cytoskeleton during cell migration and wound healing processes."
LRP10*NOLC1,"LRP10 and NOLC1 may have a functional association in neural crest specification through their interaction with TCOF1 and RNA polymerase I. LRP10 is involved in receptor-mediated internalization and interacts with multiple proteins involved in ciliogenesis, while NOLC1 regulates and interacts with RNA polymerase I to maintain ribosome processing in the nucleolus."

They both play a role in altering chromatin structure through ATP-dependent mechanisms and are involved in gene transcription regulation. Possible functional associations could be related to their roles in chromatin remodeling and gene regulation in cancer development and progression.
RBM6*RGS2,"Possible functional associations between RBM6 and RGS2: RBM6 is involved in RNA binding and may interact with FAM168B.

There is no clear biological process connecting these two genes."
PUM2*SMAD3,"Possible functional associations between PUM2 and SMAD3 involve transcriptional regulation and signal transduction pathways in cancer. PUM2 is a post-transcriptional repressor of transcripts and may regulate DCUN1D3 mRNA levels, while SMAD3 is a transcriptional modulator activated by TGF-beta and activin type 1 receptor kinases.
