interaction,summary
GPC1*RHOA,"Possible functional associations between GPC1 and RHOA in TCGA-GBM include Schwann cell myelination, prion protein conversion, inhibition of FGF-mediated signaling in skeletal muscle differentiation, and endolymph production in the inner ear. There is no direct evidence of an interaction between GPC1 and RHOA, but both genes have been shown to interact with various proteins involved in cell signaling and cytoskeleton organization, which could imply a possible functional relationship between them."
TES*TPM1,"There is no evidence for a direct functional association between TES and TPM1. TES is a scaffold protein involved in cell adhesion, proliferation regulation and potentially acts as a tumor suppressor. TPM1 is a protein that binds to actin filaments and plays a central role in muscle contraction regulation."
CASP3*JMJD6,"Possible functional associations between CASP3 and JMJD6 may involve regulation of apoptosis and RNA splicing. CASP3 is involved in the execution phase of apoptosis and cleaves many proteins, while JMJD6 regulates RNA splicing by hydroxylating U2AF2/U2AF65. The shortest path between these two genes in the BioGRID protein interaction network involves several intermediate proteins that may mediate communication between CASP3 and JMJD6 in these processes."
ARID5B*STK10,"Possible functional associations between ARID5B and STK10 include involvement in regulation of cell cycle and proliferation, as well as lymphocyte migration. ARID5B is a transcription coactivator involved in adipogenesis and liver development, while STK10 is a serine/threonine-protein kinase that mediates phosphorylation of ERM proteins and may act as a polo kinase kinase. There is no known direct functional association between these two genes based on the provided context and knowledge of biology."
RPS6*STK10,"Possible functional associations: RPS6 is involved in controlling cell growth and proliferation through translation of specific mRNA classes, while STK10 is a serine/threonine kinase involved in regulating lymphocyte migration and acting as a negative regulator of MAP3K1/MEKK1. The shortest path in the BioGRID network suggests possible interactions between RPS6 and STK10 through CD81, XPO1, TRIM25, MOV10, or KIAA1429, but further investigation is needed to determine specific functional associations between these two genes."
EDEM1*TXNDC9,"There are no obvious functional associations between EDEM1 and TXNDC9 based on their known roles in protein degradation and chaperone complex activity, respectively. However, the shortest path between the two genes in the BioGRID protein interaction network suggests they may interact indirectly through the protein SAMM50."
GRB10*HPRT1,"There is no clear functional association between GRB10 and HPRT1 based on the provided information. GRB10 is an adapter protein that regulates cell surface receptor tyrosine kinases, while HPRT1 is involved in the generation of purine nucleotides through the purine salvage pathway."
COG4*TRIM2,"Possible functional association between COG4 and TRIM2 could be related to Golgi-to-ER retrograde transport and antiviral immunity. COG4 plays a role in this process and interacts with SCFD1, while TRIM2 limits New World arenavirus infection independently of its ubiquitin ligase activity and plays a role in antiviral immunity."
STAT3*STK10,"STAT3 and STK10 may be functionally associated in regulating lymphocyte migration, as STK10 phosphorylates ERM proteins involved in this process and STAT3 is involved in regulating differentiation of na√Øve CD4(+) T-cells into T-helper Th17 cells. Additionally, both genes have roles in cell cycle regulation, with STAT3 inducing expression of key genes for the G1 to S phase transition and STK10 possibly acting as a polo kinase kinase. The BioGRID protein interaction network shows potential direct interaction between STAT3 and STK10 through RAC1 and LYN."
RAI14*TIAM1,"Possible functional associations: RAI14 and TIAM1 may be involved in regulating cell adhesion and migration through the activation of RAC1 and CDC42 signaling pathways. Additionally, RAI14 may play a role in testicular sperm polarity and spermatid adhesion."
MBOAT7*SCRN1,"Possible functional associations between MBOAT7 and SCRN1 could involve regulation of phospholipid metabolism and exocytosis in cells, as well as participation in the base excision repair complex. The interaction network suggests that they may be connected through proteins involved in the regulation of vesicle transport."
GPC1*TM9SF2,"There is no clear biological functional association between GPC1 and TM9SF2 based on their known interactions and biological functions. GPC1 is a proteoglycan involved in cell surface binding and signaling, while TM9SF2 is a hexameric protein involved in intracellular transport and ATP binding."
CHMP6*TBX2,"Possible functional associations between CHMP6 and TBX2 include regulation of endosomal sorting and transport (CHMP6) and transcriptional regulation (TBX2). While they may not directly interact in a single biological process, their functions could converge in molecular pathways related to cancer and developmental processes."
H2AFV*HSD17B10,"H2AFV and HSD17B10 are functionally associated through their interaction with CUL3, CUL4A, and CUL4B. H2AFV is involved in nucleosome formation, transcription regulation, and chromosomal stability while HSD17B10 plays a role in mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity and as a component of mitochondrial ribonuclease P complex."
BCL7B*CALU,"No functional associations can be directly inferred from the given information. BCL7B is a positive regulator of apoptosis and plays a role in the Wnt signaling pathway, while CALU is involved in the regulation of vitamin K-dependent carboxylation and interacts with GGCX. Both genes are involved in different cellular processes and do not appear to have direct functional associations."
BECN1*PLEKHM1,"Possible functional associations: BECN1 is involved in autophagy and apoptosis, while PLEKHM1 plays a role in intracellular trafficking, including in bacterial pathogenesis. It is possible that PLEKHM1 may regulate the availability or activity of BECN1 in specific contexts, such as during infection."
