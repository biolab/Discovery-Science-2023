interaction,summary
ID2*PPOX,"There are no obvious functional associations between ID2 and PPOX based on their known biological roles and interactions. ID2 is a transcriptional regulator involved in various cellular processes, while PPOX catalyzes the 6-electron oxidation of protoporphyrinogen-IX. The shortest path between the two genes in the BioGRID protein interaction network involves several intermediate proteins, suggesting they may not directly interact."
CDKN2A*USP22,"Possible functional associations between CDKN2A and USP22 include regulation of autophagy, cell cycle progression, and transcription coactivation. CDKN2A may stabilize the short-lived mitochondrial isoform through interaction with C1QBP, while USP22 is a histone deubiquitinating component of the transcription regulatory histone acetylation complex SAGA. These genes may interact through the SAGA complex and/or the MYC activator."
DUSP4*RPL39L,"Possible functional associations between DUSP4 and RPL39L include regulation of mitogenic signal transduction and biosynthesis of male germ cell-specific proteins. However, based on the protein interaction network, the shortest path between these genes involves NRAS and MAPK3, both of which are involved in growth factor signaling, suggesting a potential role in cell proliferation or survival."
HSPA8*PRAF2,"Possible functional association: HSPA8 and PRAF2 may be involved in ER/Golgi transport and vesicular traffic, as well as protein quality control and folding. There is no direct evidence of a functional association between these two genes."
KAZALD1*PPOX,"There are no obvious functional associations between KAZALD1 and PPOX based on their known biological functions and the protein interaction network. KAZALD1 is involved in bone formation and regeneration, while PPOX catalyzes the oxidation of protoporphyrinogen-IX to protoporphyrin-IX."
BIRC5*FAT1,"Possible functional association: BIRC5, a protein involved in cell proliferation and prevention of apoptosis, has a shortest path interaction with FAT1, which plays a role in cellular polarization and directed cell migration. There is currently no clear biological process linking these genes, however potential functional associations may be explored in future research on their roles in cancer development and progression in TCGA-UCEC."
CDH3*TMCO6,"Possible functional associations between CDH3 and TMCO6 are currently unknown, as they are involved in different processes: CDH3 is a calcium-dependent cell adhesion protein important for cell sorting and differentiation, while TMCO6 is an accessory subunit of the mitochondrial respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase."
PLOD3*RPL39L,"Possible functional associations between PLOD3 and RPL39L could be related to male fertility as RPL39L is a male germ cell-specific ribosomal protein, while PLOD3 plays an essential role in the biosynthesis of collagens, including those found in the basement membrane of male reproductive organs. However, there is currently no direct evidence of a functional relationship between these two genes."
CDH3*RPL39L,"There is no clear indication of a functional association between CDH3 and RPL39L based on their known roles. CDH3 is responsible for cell adhesion while RPL39L is involved in male germ cell-specific ribosome formation. However, the shortest path in the protein interaction network indicates that they may indirectly interact through NRAS."
ATP11B*GATA2,"Possible functional association between ATP11B and GATA2: ATP11B may regulate membrane lipid asymmetry in endosomes, while GATA2 is a transcriptional activator that regulates endothelin-1 gene expression in endothelial cells. It's possible that ATP11B regulates the membrane localization of GATA2 to affect its transcriptional function."
STK25*TOPBP1,"Possible functional associations between STK25 and TOPBP1 in TCGA-UCEC could be related to DNA replication and checkpoint control, as well as response to environmental stress and regulation of protein transport events. The shortest path between these genes in the BioGRID protein interaction network involves PLEKHA4, suggesting a possible role in cell adhesion and polarity complexes important for cell migration."
ENOPH1*RBKS,"Based on the provided information, there doesn't seem to be a direct or obvious functional association between ENOPH1 and RBKS. ENOPH1 is involved in the intermediate steps of a sulfur amino acid biosynthesis pathway, while RBKS is involved in the pentose phosphate pathway. However, both genes are part of a protein interaction network, suggesting they may indirectly affect each other's function through shared partners or pathways."
C2CD2L*SEC11A,"Based on the context and known functions, there are no clear functional associations between C2CD2L and SEC11A. C2CD2L is involved in phosphoinositide signaling and insulin secretion, while SEC11A is involved in protein translocation and signal peptide cleavage in the endoplasmic reticulum."
G3BP1*PUF60,"G3BP1 and PUF60 are both involved in RNA processing and have been shown to interact according to the BioGRID protein interaction network. G3BP1 plays a role in stress granule formation and innate immunity, while PUF60 is involved in pre-mRNA splicing, apoptosis, and transcriptional regulation. It is possible that these genes may function together in RNA processing, potentially in splicing regulation."
MFSD10*RPL39L,"There is no clear functional association between MFSD10 and RPL39L, as they appear to have distinct biological roles. MFSD10 is a transporter for organic anions across the luminal membranes of renal proximal tubules, while RPL39L is a male germ cell-specific component of the ribosome necessary for sperm formation."
COG7*TRAPPC3,"The possible functional association between COG7 and TRAPPC3 is their involvement in vesicular transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi. COG7 is a component of the conserved oligomeric Golgi complex required for normal Golgi morphology, while TRAPPC3 is a component of the multisubunit transport protein particle complex that includes at least 11 other subunits."
ATP11B*PLOD3,"Possible functional associations between ATP11B and PLOD3 may involve their roles in membrane lipid asymmetry maintenance and collagen biosynthesis, respectively. They may also potentially contribute to basement membrane formation. Their interaction in the BioGRID protein interaction network suggests a potential direct physical association."
