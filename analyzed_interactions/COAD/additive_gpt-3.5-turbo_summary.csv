interaction,summary
CFLAR*VDAC1,"Possible functional associations between CFLAR and VDAC1 include their involvement in the regulation of apoptosis and the formation of the permeability transition pore complex (PTPC) responsible for the release of mitochondrial products that trigger apoptosis. The BioGRID protein interaction network highlights several pathways, including interactions with RAF1, BCL2L1, GSN, RNF31, and XRCC6, which may play a role in the coordination of these processes."
CHIC2*RPS5,"There is no clear functional association between CHIC2 and RPS5 based on their known biological roles. CHIC2 is a regulatory component of the cyclin D1-CDK4 complex involved in cell cycle regulation, while RPS5 is a component of the small ribosomal subunit involved in protein synthesis."
ERBB2*HSPA8,There are no clear functional associations between ERBB2 and HSPA8. ERBB2 is involved in transcriptional regulation and enhances protein synthesis and cell growth while HSPA8 is a molecular chaperone involved in protein quality control and mitochondrial import. The shortest path between these two genes in the BioGRID protein interaction network involves intermediate proteins such as SHC1 and GRB2.
CSRP1*DECR1,"Possible functional associations between CSRP1 and DECR1 in TCGA-COAD may involve neuronal development and beta-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids in mitochondria respectively. However, their exact biological relationship remains unclear based on the provided information."
CDK6*PRR7,"One possible functional association between CDK6 and PRR7 is their involvement in cell proliferation and differentiation. CDK6 promotes G1/S transition and cell cycle progression, while PRR7 acts as a synapse-to-nucleus messenger and might play a redundant role in regulating T cell receptor signaling. However, further experimental studies are needed to determine the exact nature of their interaction and potential biological consequences."
ERBB3*GALE,"There is no clear functional association between ERBB3 and GALE based on their known biological roles and the provided context. ERBB3 is a cell surface receptor that plays a role in myeloid cell differentiation, while GALE is involved in the catabolism of galactose and the synthesis of glycoproteins and glycolipids. The shortest path between these two genes in the BioGRID protein interaction network involves several intermediary proteins."
ATF6*CCNB1,"Possible functional association: ATF6 is involved in the cellular response to endoplasmic reticulum stress, while CCNB1 is essential for cell cycle control at the G2/M transition. This suggests that CCNB1 may be a downstream target of ATF6 in regulating the cell cycle during stress responses."
FKBP4*TIPARP,"There is limited context to suggest a specific functional association between FKBP4 and TIPARP. FKBP4 is involved in intracellular trafficking of steroid hormone receptors, isomerase activity that controls neuronal growth cones, and microtubule dynamics. TIPARP is an ADP-ribosyltransferase that negatively regulates AHR."
HSPA8*KTN1,"Possible functional association: HSPA8 is a molecular chaperone involved in protein quality control, while KTN1 is a receptor for kinesin involved in vesicle motility and integrin-based adhesion. There may be a role for HSPA8 in regulating the activity or trafficking of KTN1 in these processes."
HNRNPA2B1*PTPRC,"It is difficult to determine a functional association between HNRNPA2B1 and PTPRC from the given context, as their interactions appear to be mainly influenced by microbial infections. HNRNPA2B1 is involved in RNA transport and may recognize and bind to HIV-1 genomic RNA, while PTPRC acts as a receptor for human cytomegalovirus protein UL11 and mediates its binding to T-cells."
ADCK3*ITGAE,"Possible functional associations between ADCK3 and ITGAE could be related to ubiquinone biosynthesis and adhesion of intra-epithelial T-lymphocytes to epithelial cells, respectively. However, based on the limited information provided, it is difficult to determine a specific biological interaction between these two genes."
HDAC2*SORBS3,"HDAC2 and SORBS3 may be functionally associated through their involvement in transcriptional regulation. HDAC2 is a histone deacetylase involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional repression, while SORBS3 promotes actin stress fiber formation and cell spreading through interactions with signaling molecules. The shortest path between these two genes in the BioGRID protein interaction network involves intermediate proteins related to transcriptional regulation."
CXCR4*NFKBIB,"Possible functional associations: CXCR4 acts as a coreceptor for HIV-1 and some HIV-2 isolates, while NFKBIB inhibits NF-kappa-B. They both interact with other proteins, such as THRB, RELA, and NKIRAS1/2, that are involved in immune response and inflammation. It is possible that these two genes play a role in regulating immune response and inflammation in cancer progression."
MVP*RAD51C,"Based on their interaction in the BioGRID protein interaction network, MVP and RAD51C may have a functional association in DNA repair pathways. MVP is involved in nucleo-cytoplasmic transport and down-regulation of STAT1 and SRC signaling, while RAD51C is essential in the homologous recombination pathway."
CXCR4*FOXO3,"Possible functional associations between CXCR4 and FOXO3 could involve regulation of apoptosis and autophagy processes. CXCR4 acts as a co-receptor for viral infection and interacts with Staphylococcus aureus protein SSL10, while FOXO3 acts as a transcriptional activator that regulates gene expression in response to metabolic stress and is involved in differentiation of T-regulatory cells and chondrogenic commitment of skeletal progenitor cells. There is a shortest path between the two genes through ATM."
FOXO3*NUCB2,"Possible functional associations between FOXO3 and NUCB2 may include regulation of food intake and energy homeostasis, as well as modulation of blood pressure. FOXO3 plays a role in regulating autophagy and apoptosis, while also serving as a key regulator of chondrogenic commitment and Treg differentiation. NUCB2, on the other hand, is an anorexigenic peptide and seems to interact with the GNAI3 protein subunit, which is involved in inhibiting adenylate cyclase. However, based on the provided information, there is no direct or clear functional association between these two genes."
FHL2*SCYL3,"There is currently no known functional association between FHL2 and SCYL3. FHL2 is involved in transcriptional regulation and inhibition of apoptotic function, while SCYL3 plays a role in regulating cell adhesion/migration complexes in migrating cells."
GRB7*ICAM1,"One possible functional association between GRB7 and ICAM1 is their involvement in cell migration and adhesion. GRB7 is an adapter protein that promotes downstream signaling in response to growth factors, while ICAM1 is a cell-surface adhesion molecule that mediates leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells. The shortest path between these genes in the BioGRID protein interaction network involves several intermediate proteins, suggesting a potential indirect regulatory relationship."
EIF4A3*PAFAH1B3,"Possible functional association: EIF4A3 is involved in pre-mRNA splicing as a component of the spliceosome and the mRNA splicing-dependent exon junction complex (EJC), while PAFAH1B3 is a component of the cytosolic type I platelet-activating factor (PAF) acetylhydrolase enzyme. There is currently no known direct biological relationship between these two genes."
