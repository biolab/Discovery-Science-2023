AURKA is a mitotic kinase that plays a critical role in various mitotic events, including centrosome duplication, separation, chromosomal alignment, and cytokinesis, while UBE2C acts as an essential factor of the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a cell cycle-regulated ubiquitin ligase that controls progression through mitosis. AURKA can also phosphorylate UBE2C to promote the degradation of APC/C substrates by the proteasome."
ASH2L*CDK6,"Possible functional association: ASH2L and CDK6 may be involved in regulating transcription and cell cycle progression. They both have interactions with other proteins involved in these processes, such as MLL complexes (ASH2L) and cyclins (CDK6).      ASH2L is a transcriptional regulator and a component of various histone methyltransferase complexes that regulate transcription through recruitment of those complexes to gene promoters. CDK6 is a serine/threonine-protein kinase involved in the control of the cell cycle and differentiation, promoting the G1/S transition. Both genes have interactions with proteins involved in transcription and cell cycle regulation, suggesting possible functional associations in these processes."
DHDDS*SMC4,"Possible functional associations between DHDDS and SMC4 include involvement in chromatin condensation during mitosis and protein glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum. DHDDS synthesizes precursors for sugar carriers used in protein glycosylation, while SMC4 is a central component of the condensin complex involved in chromatin condensation during mitosis. It is unclear if there is a direct functional association between these two genes in specific biological terms."
CDK6*CREB1,"Possible functional associations between CDK6 and CREB1 could be related to cell cycle control and transcription regulation. CDK6 controls G1/S transition and promotes cell proliferation, while CREB1 is a transcription factor that stimulates transcription upon binding to the DNA cAMP response element. There could be a possible involvement of these two genes in the regulation of cell proliferation through transcriptional control."
CD58*CFLAR,Possible functional association: CD58 is involved in T-lymphocyte interactions with cells and could potentially prime response by both CD2+ and LFA-3+ cells. CFLAR acts as an inhibitor of TNFRSF6-mediated apoptosis. There is no known functional association between CD58 and CFLAR in specific biological terms.
CCNA2*CCNB2,"Possible functional associations between CCNA2 and CCNB2 include their role in controlling the cell cycle at different stages by forming serine/threonine kinase holoenzyme complexes with CDK1/CDK2 and conferring substrate specificity. CCNA2 and CCNB2 interact with each other through CDK1, suggesting they may work together in regulating the cell cycle transitions."
CDK4*PAFAH1B3,"Possible functional associations between CDK4 and PAFAH1B3 may involve the regulation of cell cycle progression and development of brain, as CDK4 is a Ser/Thr-kinase component involved in G1/S transition and PAFAH1B3 is a catalytic subunit of a heterotetrameric enzyme involved in brain development. They may interact through a protein interaction network and play a role in modulating each other's enzymatic activity."
AKR7A2*DENND2D,"There is no clear functional association between AKR7A2 and DENND2D based on the given information. AKR7A2 catalyzes the reduction of succinic semialdehyde to gamma-hydroxybutyrate, while DENND2D functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for RAB9A and RAB9B. Possible connections could be explored through additional research into shared biological pathways or interaction partners."
FOSL1*STAT1,"Possible functional association: FOSL1 and STAT1 may interact in DNA damage tolerance and repair processes, as FOSL1 is involved in regulating translesion synthesis and STAT1 is activated in response to cellular stress signals and cytokines.
