CD58*TLR4,"CD58 and TLR4 may have a functional association in the innate immune response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), as TLR4 is involved in mediating this response and CD58 may prime T lymphocytes for response to antigen-presenting cells. Both genes are also involved in microbial infection responses."
AKR7A2*DENND2D,"Possible functional association: DENND2D, a GEF, may activate RAB proteins and thus contribute to intracellular protein trafficking. AKR7A2 could protect the liver from the toxic and carcinogenic effects of hepatocarcinogens like AFB1. In the context of colorectal cancer (TCGA-COAD), AKR7A2 and DENND2D are not known to be directly associated."
CDK6*CREB1,"Possible functional associations between CDK6 and CREB1 may include regulation of cell cycle progression and transcriptional activation. CDK6 is involved in the control of cell cycle and differentiation, promoting G1/S transition and phosphorylating pRB/RB1. CREB1 is a phosphorylation-dependent transcription factor that stimulates transcription upon binding to the DNA cAMP response element (CRE) and is involved in different cellular processes, including differentiation. The shortest paths between CDK6 and CREB1 in the BioGRID protein interaction network suggest potential physical interactions between these two proteins through intermediaries such as SIRT1, POGZ, and AR."
CEBPZ*NUSAP1,"Possible functional associations between CEBPZ and NUSAP1 could be in the regulation of mitosis and microtubule organization during cell division. CEBPZ stimulates transcription and interacts with proteins involved in cell signaling and DNA binding, while NUSAP1 is a microtubule-associated protein that bundles and stabilizes microtubules."
ASH2L*CDK6,"ASH2L is a transcriptional regulator involved in methylation and dimethylation of histone H3, whereas CDK6 is a serine/threonine-protein kinase involved in the control of the cell cycle and differentiation. Possible functional associations between these two genes could be in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation, as CDK6 can phosphorylate pRB/RB1 and NPM1, and ASH2L is involved in methylation and dimethylation that affects gene expression regulation. The shortest path between ASH2L and CDK6 in the BioGRID protein interaction network includes several histone methyltransferase complexes, suggesting possible functional interactions between ASH2L and CDK6 in regulating chromatin structure and gene expression."
BUB1B*CDK1,"Possible functional association: BUB1B is an essential component of the mitotic checkpoint, required for normal mitosis progression, while CDK1 is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle and acts as a receptor for hepatitis C virus (HCV) in hepatocytes. BUB1B negatively regulates PLK1 activity in interphase cells and suppresses centrosome amplification, while CDK1 inhibits the formation and nuclear import of the cyclin B1-CDK1 complex and leads to cell cycle arrest. There could be a functional association between these two genes in the regulation of the cell cycle and in their involvement in viral infections."
CCNB2*ORC1,Possible functional associations between CCNB2 and ORC1: CCNB2 interacts with CDK1 during G2/M transition and ORC1 is required for the assembly of pre-replication complex necessary for DNA replication. This suggests that CCNB2 and ORC1 may have a role in coordinating cell cycle progression and DNA replication.
