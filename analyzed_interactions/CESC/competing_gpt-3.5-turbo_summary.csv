The shortest path between the two genes in the BioGRID protein interaction network involves intermediate proteins and not a direct physical interaction."
KAT6A*KLHL9,"Possible functional association between KAT6A and KLHL9 could be related to mitotic progression and cytokinesis. KAT6A is a histone acetyltransferase that may act as a transcriptional coactivator, while KLHL9 is a substrate-specific adapter of a BCR E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex required for mitotic progression and cytokinesis. The shortest path between KAT6A and KLHL9 in the BioGRID protein interaction network also involves a protein (HNRNPL) that is involved in splicing and mRNA processing, suggesting potential associations with gene expression."
MBNL1*NCAPD2,"There aren't any obvious functional associations between MBNL1 and NCAPD2 based on their known processes, as they both have distinct roles in alternative splicing and chromosome condensation, respectively. However, it's possible that they may interact indirectly through shared interactions with other proteins or regulatory pathways."
CRKL*MBNL1,"Possible functional associations between CRKL and MBNL1 could be in alternative splicing regulation and signal transduction.

The shortest path between the two genes in the BioGRID protein interaction network suggests a potential physical interaction between them in alternative splicing regulation."
ZMYM2*ZNF589,"There is no clear biological basis for a functional association between ZMYM2 and ZNF589, based on their known functions, protein interactions, and involvement in different biological processes. ZMYM2 is involved in transcriptional regulation and may interact with histone deacetylase complexes, while ZNF589 is involved in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell differentiation and binds to DNA as a transcriptional repressor."
GLOD4*SMARCC1,"Possible functional associations between GLOD4 and SMARCC1 could be that they both play a role in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling. Specifically, GLOD4 may inhibit LPXN nuclear accumulation and limit SRF-dependent gene transcription, while SMARCC1 is involved in the activity of genes essential for dendrite growth and regulating the switch from neural stem/progenitor cells to postmitotic neurons. However, without further experimental evidence, any functional association between these two genes remains speculative."
HIF1A*SMAD3,"Possible functional association: HIF1A is involved in the response to hypoxia and infection, whereas SMAD3 is a transcriptional modulator activated by TGF-beta. They regulate different biological processes, but could potentially interact in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation, as well as in inflammatory responses. However, no direct biological association between these two genes has been reported in the literature."
IKBKB*PTPN12,"Possible functional association between IKBKB and PTPN12 is that PTPN12 regulates signaling via ERBB2 and PTK2B/PYK2, and IKBKB phosphorylates IKK-related kinases TBK1 and IKBKE, which can participate in cytokine-stimulated activation of ERBB2. This suggests that both genes may play a role in regulating cytokine signaling and cell growth in cancer."
