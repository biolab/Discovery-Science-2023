PPOX: Catalyzes the 6-electron oxidation of protoporphyrinogen-IX to form protoporphyrin-IX and acts as a monomer homodimer."
LRRC16A*MOK,"LRRC16A and MOK do not appear to have a direct functional association. LRRC16A is involved in actin polymerization and cell migration, while MOK is able to phosphorylate substrates and negatively regulates cilium length. The shortest path in their interaction network involves HUWE1 as an intermediate protein."
CRKL*MAPKAPK2,"Possible functional associations between CRKL and MAPKAPK2 include regulation of cytokine production, cell migration, chromatin remodeling, and DNA damage response. However, no direct interactions have been reported between these two genes in the literature."
NR3C1*SOX4,"Possible functional associations between NR3C1 and SOX4 in TCGA-CESC cancer could be related to the regulation of gene expression and transcriptional activation. NR3C1 is a transcription factor that binds to DNA and interacts with coactivator complexes to activate gene expression, while SOX4 is a transcriptional activator that binds to enhancer motifs to modulate gene expression. It is possible that these genes interact to regulate gene expression in cervical cancer."
CYCS*EIF4EBP1,"There are no known functional associations between CYCS and EIF4EBP1 in specific biological processes. CYCS plays a role in apoptosis, while EIF4EBP1 regulates translation initiation."
CAT*HSPA1A,"CAT and HSPA1A have a short interaction through multiple proteins, such as ABL2, ENO1 and PEX5. Although there is no direct biological functional association known between CAT and HSPA1A, these genes are involved in anti-oxidant and stress response pathways, respectively."
LIG1*PAN2,"Possible functional associations between LIG1 and PAN2 include regulation of mRNA turnover and stability, potentially through LIG1's interactions with PCNA and PAN2's involvement in deadenylation. Both genes are involved in DNA repair and metabolism, but their specific functions do not directly overlap."
MTX2*SIRT3,"Possible functional association: Both MTX2 and SIRT3 are involved in mitochondrial processes. MTX2 is involved in mitochondrial protein transport while SIRT3 is a NAD-dependent deacetylase that regulates cellular energy metabolism and promotes mtDNA transcription. Given their related mitochondrial roles, it is possible that these two genes may interact in regulatory pathways involving mitochondrial functions. However, there is currently no known direct interaction between MTX2 and SIRT3 based on the BioGRID protein interaction network."
MAPK13*PTPRF,Possible functional association: MAPK13 is a serine/threonine kinase involved in the regulation of cellular responses. PTPRF is a protein tyrosine phosphatase with enzymatic activity. They interact indirectly through KRAS and may participate in the regulation of insulin secretion and epidermal keratinocyte differentiation and apoptosis. Further experimentation is necessary to determine a more specific functional relationship between these genes.
RNH1*SYK,"Possible functional associations between RNH1 and SYK could be in the regulation of redox homeostasis and signal transduction downstream of transmembrane receptors, specifically in B-cell receptor (BCR) and T-cell receptor signaling. SYK mediates several biological processes including innate and adaptive immunity, cell adhesion, osteoclast maturation, platelet activation, and vascular development, while RNH1 inhibits ribonucleases and forms high-affinity heterodimers with RNASE1, ANG, and RNASE2."
BNIP3L*XBP1,"Possible functional associations: Based on the BioGRID interaction network and context, BNIP3L and XBP1 may be involved in the regulation of apoptosis and the unfolded protein response in the endoplasmic reticulum. BNIP3L induces apoptosis and is involved in mitochondrial quality control, while XBP1 is a stress-inducible transcriptional activator that up-regulates target genes encoding ER chaperones and ER-associated degradation components to maintain ER homeostasis under stress."
CDK2*EML3,"Possible functional associations between CDK2 and EML3 involve their roles in regulating cell cycle progression, cell proliferation, and DNA repair. CDK2 functions as a serine/threonine-protein kinase that is essential for meiosis and modulates cell cycle progression, while EML3 regulates mitotic spindle assembly and chromosome separation during cell division.
