interaction,summary
PSMD4*TXNRD1,"Possible functional association between PSMD4 and TXNRD1: PSMD4 is involved in the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins and interacts with several proteins including TP53, which is implicated in regulating TXNRD1. TXNRD1 enhances the transcriptional activity of estrogen receptors and mediates cell death induction. Therefore, PSMD4 may play a role in regulating TXNRD1 function through protein degradation and protein-protein interactions."
TWF2*ZMYM2,"Possible functional associations between TWF2 and ZMYM2 could involve regulation of gene transcription and endocytosis. TWF2 is involved in actin polymerization inhibition and regulation of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, while ZMYM2 is involved in negative regulation of transcription and is a component of a histone deacetylase complex."
CDKN2A*MAP7,"Possible functional associations between CDKN2A and MAP7 in TCGA-BRCA may involve regulation of autophagy and microtubule stabilization during reorganization of microtubules and formation of intercellular contacts. However, additional research is needed to fully understand the extent of their interaction and biological role."
PAK1*TERF2IP,"Possible functional associations between PAK1 and TERF2IP are unclear based on the provided information. PAK1 is involved in various processes including regulation of the cytoskeleton, cell migration, tumor cell invasion, and transcription regulation. TERF2IP is involved in telomere function and transcription regulation. They are not known to directly interact in any of these processes."
ARNT2*CEBPD,"Possible functional associations between ARNT2 and CEBPD include their co-regulation of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses, as well as their interaction with other proteins such as PRDM16 and TACC3. ARNT2 plays a role in development and function of the hypothalamo-pituitary axis, postnatal brain growth, and visual and renal function, while CEBPD is a transcriptional activator involved in regulation of IL6 expression."
NOSIP*WDR7,"Possible functional association between NOSIP and WDR7: involvement in ribosome biogenesis as both genes are part of the small subunit (SSU) processome, with WDR7 being directly involved in nucleolar processing and pre-18S ribosomal RNA transcription while NOSIP interacts with PP2A holoenzyme with PPP2R1A subunit, which also participates in ribosome biogenesis by dephosphorylating and activating RNA polymerase I."
ARHGEF12*ICAM3,"Possible functional associations between ARHGEF12 and ICAM3 could be related to regulation of RhoA GTPase and leukocyte adhesion, as ARHGEF12 is a GEF for RhoA and ICAM3 is a ligand for integrin alpha-L/beta-2 and alpha-D/beta-2. The shortest path in the BioGRID protein interaction network between ARHGEF12 and ICAM3 is through EZR, which may also be involved in leukocyte adhesion."
HSPD1*PGM1,"Possible functional associations between HSPD1 and PGM1 could be related to glucose metabolism in the mitochondria, as HSPD1 is involved in mitochondrial protein import and macromolecular assembly, while PGM1 participates in glucose breakdown and synthesis. However, more research is needed to confirm any direct biological interactions between the two genes."
CDKN2A*STAMBP,"Possible functional associations between CDKN2A and STAMBP include regulation of cell growth and signal transduction mediated by IL-2 and GM-CSF, as well as involvement in cell surface receptor-mediated endocytosis and lysosomal sorting. CDKN2A may also be involved in autophagy and caspase-independent cell death, while STAMBP plays a key role in negative regulation of PI3K-AKT-mTOR and RAS-MAP signaling pathways. There is no clear biological process linking these two genes."
ATP11B*EBP,"There are no known functional associations between ATP11B and EBP in specific biological terms. ATP11B is involved in maintaining membrane lipid asymmetry, while EBP catalyzes the conversion of specific sterols."
LSM5*POLR2K,"Possible functional associations between LSM5 and POLR2K may involve their roles in transcription and mRNA processing. LSM5 is involved in pre-mRNA splicing as a component of the spliceosome complex, while POLR2K is a common component of all RNA polymerases. It is possible that LSM5 and POLR2K interact in the pre-mRNA splicing process or through regulation of RNA transcription and processing."
EML3*NSA2,"Possible functional association: EML3 and NSA2 might be involved in the regulation of cell division, as EML3 plays a role in mitotic spindle assembly and chromosome separation, while NSA2 is involved in ribosomal subunit biogenesis, a necessary process for cell growth and division."
FAM63A*TSPAN4,"Possible functional associations between FAM63A and TSPAN4 include their interactions in the BioGRID protein interaction network, where the shortest path between them includes proteins involved in spliceosomes, snRNPs, and receptor tyrosine-phosphorylated ITAM domains. FAM63A is a hydrolase that specifically removes 'Lys-48'-linked conjugated ubiquitin from proteins, while TSPAN4 is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that mediates signal transduction downstream of various transmembrane receptors, including classical immunoreceptors like the B-cell receptor."
PGM1*SLC25A14,"Possible functional associations between PGM1 and SLC25A14 could be related to metabolism or energy production, as both genes play roles in glucose breakdown and mitochondrial function respectively. However, without further experimental evidence, it is unclear if there is a direct biological interaction between these two genes."
CDKN2A*MMP1,"Possible functional association: CDKN2A may be involved in regulating the autophagy and caspase-independent cell death, while MMP1 cleaves collagen types I, II, III, VII, and X.   These genes may be functionally associated in extracellular matrix remodeling, as MMP1 cleaves collagens and CDKN2A has been shown to regulate cell death. Additionally, the interaction between MMP1 and HIV-1 Tat could suggest a potential role in viral infection."
MYC*SPDEF,"MYC and SPDEF have a shortest path in the BioGRID protein interaction network, suggesting they may interact with each other in some way. MYC is a transcription factor that binds DNA and regulates the expression of growth-related genes, while SPDEF may play a role in the regulation of the prostate gland and/or prostate cancer development as a transcriptional activator. It is possible that MYC and SPDEF interact in the context of prostate cancer."
TBP*TIMM17B,"Possible functional associations: TBP is a basal transcription factor that plays a major role in the initiation of RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription, while TIMM17B is an essential component of the TIM23 complex that mediates the translocation of proteins across the mitochondrial inner membrane. There do not appear to be any direct biological processes connecting these two genes."
ARHGEF12*PSMB10,"Possible functional association: PSMB10 is involved in antigen processing, a process closely tied to tumor immune surveillance. ARHGEF12 regulates the activity of RhoA GTPase, which has been shown to play a role in cancer cell invasion and metastasis."
